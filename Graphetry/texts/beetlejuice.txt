                    ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND
                               ARE
                           ON VACATION!
                              HOORAY!




                         
                  I'm ready!







                         
                  She's ready.


                         
                  It looks great.


                         
                  Thanks.




                  Happy vacation, honey!

                         (playfully grabs
                          Barbara and kisses
                          her)
                  Where did you get it?


                  Helen got it for me in Oslo.
                  There's enough to refinish the
                  gateleg table and the cherry
                  wardrobe...






                  Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.




                  Enough to do the guest room...


                         
                  I'm so glad we're spending our
                  vacation at home...
                         
                  ... I'm going to get started right
                  now!


                         
                  Whoa!... hold on...






                         
                  No one's home!





                  Oh no.


                         
                  It's your turn, darling.

































                  Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you.
                  I heard you were on vacation!


                  That's right, Jane.  Complete
                  vacation.


                  Honey -- today I am three hundred
                  fifty thousand dollars!


                  No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the
                  morning!


                  Look at me, think of me as cash!
                  This offer is really real!  From a
                  rich man in New York City who only
                  saw a photograph!
                         
                  My buyer has just made a killing
                  in condos in Manhattan, but he's
                  got a little stress problem...
                         
                  ... so -- he wants to bring the
                  wife and kid for the old peace and
                  quiet.


                  That's what we're looking for,
                  too.


                  Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just
                  listen now.  This house is too
                  big.  It really ought to be for a
                  couple with a family.




                         
                  Oh, honey... I didn't mean
                  anything... it's just too big for
                  you.





                         
                  'Bye, Jane, see you in a few
                  weeks.
















                  Oh, honey.  You said no Inkspots
                  on this vacation!










                         (her huge face
                          grinning at him)
                  Boo!




                  No, Jane.
















                         (calling to distant
                          Barbara)
                  Honey, come with me down to the
                  store?


                  What for?


                  I need a good brush for this Tung
                  oil and I want to pick up a piece
                  of the model.  Let's go early
                  before anyone sees us.





                  Okay, but let's hurry back.  You
                  just run in okay?


















                         
                  Jane said we should sell the house
                  to someone with a family.


                  Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.









                  We should be flattered that she
                  wants to sell our house.


                  I know... I just wish she'd leave
                  us alone.


                  Let's not think about it.  We'll
                  have a nice romantic, quiet,
                  vacation.  Here comes the bridge
                  chorus.









                  Chances are... When I wear a
                  foolish grin...

                  Don't forget the balls, Ernie.


                         
                  Adam!










                        JANE BUTTERFIELD

                           REAL ESTATE
                             TRAVEL
















                  Y... ello.  Mrs. Deetz?  Well the
                  condition is what we country folk
                  call, fixin'... Yes, I think they
                  are fixin' to accept another
                  offer.  Well maybe if you offer
                  390,000 they'll take it.











                  'Morning, Adam.  You need a
                  haircut before your vacation?


                  No thanks, Bill.


                  How's the model coming?


                  Good, Bill -- Good.





                  Y'know, I was thinkin'... you said
                  Bozman built the foundation in
                  1835 but y'know his grandson came
                  in here last week and said he
                  found a bottle with an 1836 stamp
                  in it plastered in the foundation.
                         (suddenly disgusted
                          at the memory)
                  He's got hair down to his
                  goddamned shoulders...









                  He said "Just give me a trim..." I
                  took a scissors to him so fast...
                  would've skimmed him clean if he
                  hadn't...




                  See you, Bill.


                  Right.






















                  It's a beauty.


                  Yeah it turned out okay.  We
                  applied for a historical plaque
                  for it.  That'll be the third one
                  on Main Street.


                         
                  With all these historical
                  landmarks in town, where are they
                  going to put the condominiums?


                         
                  Slow down there, honey... I don't
                  want the vibration to weaken the
                  model.


                         
                  Oh... I'm sorry...



















































                  Something like this always happens
                  when we try to go on vacation.
                  Always.




                  You'll feel better when you're
                  dry.






                  This fire wasn't burning when we
                  left the house.


                  How's your arm?


                  I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.













                  Oh, Adam.















                  You'd better sit down, hon.


                  I am sitting.


                  I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I
                  don't think we survived that
                  crash.


                         
                  Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own
                  house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some
                  coffee.  You get some more
                  firewood.





                  Let's take things extra slow.  Do
                  you remember how we got back up
                  here?





                  I'm fine.  My arm works fine.













                         
                  The end of a perfect day.




                  Honey, I'm gonna go down to the
                  bridge and retrace our steps.





                  Adam!














                  Barbara?





                         
                  Where are you?












































                         
                  You saved my -- uh -- life... or
                  whatever...


                  Two hours.


                  What?


                  That's how long you were gone.


                         
                  ... Hmmm?







                  Anything happen while I was away?


                  Yes, it did.  Yes, it did.  I made
                  a couple of small discoveries.













                         
                  There's that, and there's this.









                         
                  Handbook for the recently
                  diseased.


                  Deceased.  I don't know where it
                  came from.  Look at the publisher.


                         
                  Handbook for the Recently Deceased
                  Press.


                         (finally admit-
                          ting it)
                  I don't think we survived the
                  crash.










                  I don't like situations like this.
                  I hate it when I'm not in control.
                  So just tell me the basics.


                  This book isn't arranged that
                  way.  What do you want to know?


                  There are a thousand things... Why
                  did you disappear when you walked
                  off the front porch?  Is this a
                  punishment?  Are we halfway to
                  heaven or are we halfway to hell?
                  And how long is this going to
                  last?


                  I don't see anything about
                  "Rewards and Punishments" or
                  "Heaven and Hell."
                         
                  This book reads like stereo
                  instructions!  Listen to this...
                  'Geographical and Temporal
                  Perimeters... Functional
                  perimeters vary from manifestation
                  to manifestation."  This is going
                  to take some time.







                  I knew I'd never finish the guest
                  room.  Adam, we just can't stay in
                  here forever!







                         
                  Maybe we should set up a normal
                  routine.




                         
                  I mean, let's try to nail down
                  something in our lives.  A regular
                  schedule.  We can keep track of
                  time and go on with our projects
                  up here in the attic.





                  Oh, God, maybe this is all just a
                  bad dream.




                  I'm afraid not, honey.




                  Why?  What's wrong?  Adam?









































                  I wish I had a better view of the
                  cemetery from up here.  I don't
                  know which area is the best
                  placement for us.





                         
                  Cabin fever, han?


                  I can't clean anything.  The
                  vacuum is out in the garage.  I
                  can't leave the house.  Why don't
                  they tell us something?  Where are
                  all the other dead people in the
                  world?  Why is it just you and me?


                  Maybe this is heaven.


                         (looking at the
                          dusty walls)
                  In heaven there wouldn't be dust
                  on the wallpaper.


                  Hon... I didn't want to die, but
                  really, this is fine with me.
                  Look, we never have to wash dishes
                  again.


                  Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three
                  weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you.  I
                  really need to be around people,
                  get out to the church and go
                  grocery shopping.


                  But I'm not hungry, are you?





                  I keep having this feeling that
                  something has got to happen.















                  God, it's Jane.


                  What's she doing here?


                  I don't know.
                         
                  Jane, Jane, up here!














                  She can't see you, right?




                         
                  In the book, Rule Number Two:  the
                  living usually won't see the dead.


                  Won't?  Or can't?


                  Just says "won't."  Wait a minute.
                  Here it says "the living are
                  arrogant... they think they'll
                  never die, so they refuse to see
                  the dead."


                  Arrogant.  That's Jane all right...




                  At least we won't have to worry
                  about her.





















































                  Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.


                  Don't worry.  It was going anyway.







































                         
                  Jesus.  Who lived here?  The
                  Waltons?







                         
                  Get all this other crap out of
                  here.





                         
                  Where is your father?... probably
                  in the kitchen.








                  The noise in that kitchen.  Noisy
                  refrigerator, noisy faucets...
                  We'll have to replace it all.  I
                  want no humming in the house.














                         
                  What do you think, honey?


                  Delia hates it.




                         
                  I could live here.





                  Settle down, Lydia.  I wonder
                  where we are going to get
                  counseling for you out here.





                  Help!  Oh help!












                  It's Otho!


                  Otho, why didn't you just come in
                  the door?




                  It's bad luck.  And I believe
                  hugely in luck.


                  Hold your breath and we'll pull.























                  That was the single most
                  unattractive window treatment I
                  have ever seen in the entire of my
                  existence.


                         
                  I'm so glad you could leave the
                  city to consult me, Otho.





                  Yes, of course you are.  Well,
                  Otho had an intuition.  Call it a
                  hunch -- that it was going to be a
                  fabled monstrosity of a house.
                  And it certainly is.  Charles,
                  you're lucky the yuppies are
                  buying condos, so you can afford
                  what I'm going to have to do to
                  this place.  We are talking from
                  the ground ups'ville!


                  That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me
                  out of it.  I am here to relax and
                  clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I
                  mean to do it.






                         
                  Is the rest of the house as bad as
                  this?


                  The rest of the house is probably
                  worse.  When can you and I get
                  started?


                  No time like the present, as my
                  wicked stepmother used to say.







                  Delia, let's get this show on the
                  road.








                  Adam, we are in hell.  I hate
                  these people.


                  They make Jane look good.


                  Is this a punishment for something
                  we did in life?  What can we do?


                         
                  We're not completely helpless.
                  I've been reading the book.
                  There's a word for people in our
                  predicament, honey.




                         
                  Ghosts!







                  We're dealing with negative
                  entertainment potential here.  I
                  mean, there's absolutely no organic
                  walking flow-through.





                  What's wrong?


                  I thought I saw something.





                  Okay?


                         
                  You read my mind!  I love clients
                  who can read my mind.  I don't
                  think people realize how strong a
                  connection there is between
                  interior design and the
                  supernatural.


                         
                  I know... I read your book, The
                  Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.


                  Gooood!




                  This will be Lydia's room.










                  What do you think?


                  Viridian?


                  Viridian?  What is...?






                  Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic
                  oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in
                  chemistry.  I was a hair analyst!
                  Briefly.  Interior design is a
                  science, Delia!  Think of me as
                  Doctor Otho.
                         
                  And this patient is truly sick!


                  Of course, her favorite color!
                  How beautiful!

















                  Oh my God!


                  We just have to pray that the
                  other closets are bigger than this
                  one.




                         
                  Were these people dwarfes? 
                         
                  Oooooo!...  Look!







                         
                  Ozzie...
                         (holding up
                          her dress)
                  ... and... Harriet!  What happened
                  to these people?




                  They died.


















                  Ooo.  Deliver me from L.L. Bean!














                         
                  This room is off limits.  I don't
                  want either of you to touch one
                  piece of furniture in here.  This
                  is my room.








                  They don't see us.  They can't
                  hear us.




                  The woman who lived here had the
                  aesthetic instincts of Betty
                  Crocker.


                  I'm going to get her.


                  I cannot convey to you the extent
                  to which this house bores me.


                         (looking around
                          scientifically)
                  Once you cover up the wallpaper,
                  knock down a few walls, alter the
                  traffic patterns, and -- perhaps
                  -- think about an inground pool --
                  the place might just be livable.
                  What's on the third floor?


                  Attic space.


                  Let's see.  We could turn that
                  into a media room.









                  Oh, God.  I forgot to lock the
                  attic door!












                  Did you feel something?




                         
                  I felt a cool wind.























                  You don't have a key?


                  Maybe Charles does.


                  I have a feeling there's some very
                  interesting space behind this
                  door.


                         
                  Probably the world's largest
                  Reader's Digest collection!
                  C'mon, let's have some chablis,
                  Otho, I'm laid bare by this
                  experience.  Entirely bare.









                  Whew!  That was close.


                  I cannot witness this.














                  What's the good of being a ghost
                  if you can't frighten people to
                  death?


                  Oh, honey...


                  No, I'm not putting up with this.











                  Barbara, honey!  Don't go out
                  there.  You don't know --


                  Nothing can be worse than this...





                  Barbara!
















                  Barbara!
















                  Oh Adam.  Find somebody.  I'm
                  getting all yellow.  Do something!




























































                  Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me
                  alone.


                  You left me.


                  I know.  I'm sorry.




                         
                  I just realized that I could have
                  been killed alone.  Don't ever
                  leave me, honey.




                         
                  We're trapped in this house
                  forever... with those... people.


                  You can't say that for sure.  It
                  could be a transitional thing.
                  Like a post-life crisis.  We just
                  have to be tougher with them.
                  Come on.  Have some brandy.
                  Spirits?


                         
                  Death didn't improve your sense of
                  humor.



















                  I can't believe that we're eating
                  Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan
                  up here?  Hunan?


                  There's only one Chinese
                  restaurant out here, darling, the
                  owners are Irish and Irish people
                  happen to cook Cantonese.  They
                  don't know better.


                  I plan to have a stroke from the
                  amount of MSG that's in this food.


                  This is our first meal in this
                  house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do
                  our little private parts to make
                  it a pleasant one?


                  Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a
                  darkroom in the basement.


                         
                  My whole life is a darkroom!
                  One... big... dark... room.





                  Nonsense... you'll go to school,
                  maybe meet a farm boy.




                         
                  Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll
                  let me hang myself from a rope in
                  his barn.


                  Lydia, in a couple of years this
                  whole town will be filled with
                  people like us.


                  We'll be the art center of summer
                  New York.  I'll start sculpting
                  again... I'll teach those gallery
                  bastards to refuse my sculpture.
                  And when Otho and I get through
                  with this house, you people are
                  not going to recognize it.


                         
                  I say let's keep it the way it is.




                         
                  Good idea!




                  I do.  I really like it.  I
                  mean, it's already sort of like
                  somebody's home, isn't it?  Their
                  couch is comfortable and doesn't
                  stick to your legs.  It smells
                  like a real home, not a French
                  whorehouse.


                  Lydia, at your age, you are so
                  young.
                         
                  Charles, we need to call that
                  awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow
                  and get the key to the attic door.
                  Can't you find a way to hold back
                  some of her commission?


                  We're going to have a lot to do
                  tomorrow...
                  The Goodwill truck is coming.


                  ... and whatever is up there in
                  that attic goes away with it.


                  Should have it fumigated, too.  I
                  saw a fly today.





































                  Look in the index...


                  Not really...  what's this?







                         
                  Having difficulty adjusting?
                  Is death a problem and not a
                  solution?  Unhappy with eternity?
                  Troubled by the living?  Call
                  Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
                  That's Betelgeuse,  Betel...







                  That's it?  No number, or
                  instructions?


                  Nothing.  The bio-exorcist?  I
                  don't get it...










                         (shouting through
                          the window)
                  What the hell are you trying to do
                  out there?






































                  Are you a boy or a girl?


                  I only speak to vertebrates.


                  What happened to the people who
                  used to live here?


                         
                  They drowned!


                  Yes, they were family.  I was
                  devastated.
                         
                  Here, darling.




                         
                  Is this the key to the attic?


                  That's a skeleton key.  It'll open
                  any door in that house.  Will you
                  give it to your father?
                         (handing her a
                          business card)
                  And you might mention that I
                  single-handedly decorated the
                  house.  In case he needs advice in
                  that area.  Come see me.










                  Help!  Get off me!
















                  You jerks!  That is my art, and it
                  is dangerous!  You think I want to
                  want to die like that?
                         
                  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair.
                  So buckle down now and go get
                  Mommy some drugs.


                  Any particular kind?


                  Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!









                  That little girl saw us.


                  She couldn't have.  We can't make
                  them see us.


                  But she saw us.  I could feel it.


                         (pause, thinking
                          that over)
                  That's all we need.



































                         
                  Don't worry.  I've locked it.







































                         
                  Have the living got you down?
                  Betelgeuse!
                  Are they jacking you around?
                  Betelgeuse!
                  Have you broken out in hives
                  'Cause you're tired of their jive?
                  I will drive them from your
                  hive... Betelgeuse!












                  Say it once... Betelgeuse
                  Say it twice... Betelgeuse.
                  The third time's a charm...
                  Betelgeuse!
                  Come on down!















                  What are you doing?














                  I was just trying to open the
                  door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought
                  over a skeleton key.


                  Let me have it.










                  But it doesn't work.





                  Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway,
                  this can wait.  We'll get a
                  crowbar later.  Where's your
                  mother?


                         (very quick de-
                          cisive delivery)
                  Stepmother.


                  I'm going down to relax.  I want a
                  noise-free zone.  Do you
                  understand?  Noise-free.




                  Dad?




                         (irritated, over
                          his shoulder)
                  What?


                  I'm lonely.





                  What?







                  Nothing.
















                         (looking through
                          the handbook)
                  We need some help.  I found
                  something this morning.  Here.
                  Emergencies.
                         
                  "In case of emergency, draw door."


                  Draw door?  I don't know why we
                  keep looking in that stupid book.





                         
                  You don't actually think this
                  is going to work?





                  Yet another triumph for Adam and
                  Barbara in the afterlife.  Why
                  don't we try this Beetle guy??...


                  Wait.









                         
                  Aha!  Knock three times.









































































                  Jesus Christ!




                         
                  Darling, can't you see I'm
                  relaxing in here!


                  Well I just wanted to tell you
                  what I saw.


                  Lydia.  What the hell is the point
                  of my moving up here if you people
                  won't let me relax?  Go help your
                  mother.





                         
                  Fine.  Maybe you can relax in a
                  haunted house.  But I can't.



















                  Nice building... Bad paint.  Good
                  lines... bad roof.  Good
                  parking... hmmm???







                  Botco International.


                  Yes, I'd like to speak with Maxie
                  Dean.


                  He's not in right now.


                  Well tell him that Charles Deetz
                  called.





                         
                  My God what I could do with that
                  parking.











                  ... Not what I expected when we
                  walked through that door.


                  No. But it's somewhere without big
                  worms.


























                  You don't have an appointment, do
                  you?


                  W... We didn't know how to make one.


                  An appointment for what?


                  What do you want?


                  We need some help.


                  Already?  You just bit the big one
                  nine months ago and you want help?


                  Nine months?  What difference does
                  that make?


                         
                  Good luck.  You're going to use up
                  all your help vouchers.


                  Help vouchers?


                  D-90's.  You spend a hundred
                  and twenty-five years on earth,
                  actually, in that house, during
                  which you get only three class-one
                  D-90 intercessions with Juno.  You
                  probably haven't even read through
                  the manual completely yet.


                  Why three?








                  Rule Number Three.  Everything
                  comes in threes...


                  You'll have to wait if you don't
                  have an appointment.


                  How long do we have to wait?


                  Wait for who?


                  For Juno, your caseworker.  Not
                  that it matters to your type.  But
                  there are all these other people
                  here ahead of you.  I'd say 3
                  hours.

                  Is this what happens when you die?




                  This is what happens when YOU die.
                         (points to another
                          corpse)
                  That is what happens when HE dies.
                  That is what happens when THEY
                  die.  It's highly personal.  And
                  I'll tell you something... if I
                  knew then what I know now... I
                  wouldn't have had my little
                  "accident!"





                         
                  Amen!



















                  Maitland, party of two!  Take your
                  handbook and go to the sixth door.




                  We forgot our handbook.









                         (from distant
                          downstairs)
                  Lydia, Delia needs your help!





                  Right now, Delia says!





                         (shaking her head
                          in disgust)
                  Out that way, through the typing
                  pool, down the corridor, sixth
                  door on your left.  Sixth door.
                  Two threes.
                         
                  Airhead.



















                  How do I look?  There're no
                  mirrors on this side.


                         (trying to be
                          pleasant)
                  Fine, you look fine.


                  Thanks.  I've been feeling a
                  little flat.





















                  A hundred twenty-five years!
                  I can't believe it.  I can't
                  believe they didn't tell us.













                  Adam, look at this.









                         
                  Oh, Adam... what is this?









                  That's the lost souls room.
                  A room for ghosts who have been
                  exorcised.  Poor devils.  That's
                  death for the dead.  It's all in
                  the handbook.  Keep moving.







                  This is it... the sixth door.

















                  My God, we're back home.


                  Look at this, everything is
                  different down here.  All our
                  furniture is gone.


                  How long do you suppose we were
                  waiting?


                  Three months.












                  I'd nearly given up on you.  I was
                  about to leave.  I do have other
                  clients.


                  Are you Juno, our caseworker?


                  Yes.  I evaluate individual cases
                  and determine if help is needed,
                  deserved, and available.


                  We need help.  We deserve help.


                  Are you available?


                  No.
                         
                  What's wrong?


                  We're very unhappy.


                  What do you expect?  You're dead.


                  We'd like some help in getting rid
                  of the people who moved in here.
                  Barbara and I worked very hard on
                  this house.


                  We probably wouldn't mind sharing
                  the house with people who were --


                  -- like you used to be?


                  Yes.


                  But these people --












                  Things seem pretty quiet here.
                  You should thank God you didn't
                  die in Italy.
                         
                  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been
                  studying the manual?


                  We tried.


                  The Intermediate Interface chapter
                  on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em
                  out yourself.  It's your house.
                  Haunted houses don't come easy.


                  We don't quite get it.




                  I heard.
                         
                  Tore your face right off!  Bad
                  news.  It obviously doesn't do
                  any good to pull your heads off in
                  front of people if they can't see
                  you.


                  We have to start simpler, is that
                  it?


                  Start simply.  Do what you know.
                  Use your talents.  Practice.  We
                  only help those who help
                  themselves.  Just do a little at a
                  time.  And of course, practice,
                  practice, practice.  It's tricky
                  but -- you weren't murderers by
                  any chance, were you?


                  No.


                  Pity.  Murderers seem to have an
                  easy time of it.  Just look at
                  Amityville.
                         
                  He was one of my boys.  Didn't
                  have to give that one any lessons.
                  From day one... But I must be
                  off... I've got a plane load of
                  football players crashed in the
                  midwest... they need a lot of
                  help, just with the basics.




                  If... we have trouble.  What about
                  the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...


                         (quickly interrupt-
                          ing her)
                  Don't say his name, you don't want
                  his help.




                  Well... We might...








                  No you don't!  He does not work
                  well with others.


                  What do you mean?  What's he do?






                  I wasn't going to bring it up --
                  but rather than have you stumble
                  into it and make another mistake,
                  I'll tell you --
                         (she nervously puffs
                          her cigarette)
                  He was my assistant, but he was a
                  troublemaker...
                  He went out on his own as a free-
                  lance bio-exorcist -- claims to
                  get rid of the living... got into
                  more trouble -- you remember the
                  Chicago Fire...




                         
                  He was demoted to a Grade-6
                  malevolent spirit.  He's been
                  imprisoned on that plane ever
                  since... in fact, I believe he's
                  been sleezing around your cemetery
                  lately.  He can only be brought
                  back by saying his name three
                  times.




                         
                  But I strongly suggest that you
                  remove the Deetz's yourself.






                  And if we need you again, how do
                  we...?





                  That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh,
                  Adam.


                         (holds her shoul-
                          ders, calms her)
                  Look, she's right.  We'll just
                  start simple, honey, be tougher.
                  I feel... confident.  C'mon.
















                  Pssstt!  Over here!










                  I can't use this.  You should have
                  it.  Flies get so little respect
                  anymore.









                  Buzzz!
                         
                  Help me!  Help me!

















                  Maxie, have I not always made you
                  money?  I think that is the only
                  real question here.












                  Well, Charles -- no one has made me
                  money like you.  Until your nerves
                  went, you were a demon.  It is
                  just that... Winter River,
                  Connecticut is, you'll forgive me,
                  no fucking where.  Why would I
                  invest that kind of money to buy
                  an old building way the hell up
                  there?





                  Not a building!  That's the beauty
                  of it.  I think I can buy the
                  whole town.  These people don't
                  know the value of their property!


                  Then we own a whole town full of
                  nowhere.


                  No, No -- C'mon, Max, you know
                  me.  I've got plans.  You gotta
                  come up here and see, then I'll
                  tell you about it.




                  Well, sure, Charles, but I am busy
                  here... you know how it was when
                  you were active.






                         
                  Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody.


                  No listen... we'll talk about
                  this visiting later, I gotta go,
                  I gotta meeting on the Japanese
                  joint venture.


                         (torn between the
                          MOANING and Maxie)
                  Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese
                  could run it for us.  Listen,
                  think right about it, will you?
                  We've almost got the house ready,
                  you bring Sarah with you and I'll
                  show you.


                  Yeah yeah, we'll think on it.
                  Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up
                  there, ya hear?




                         
                  Putz!  Inter River?  My ass.













                  Oh, Jesus, Lydia!  Is Connecticut
                  so boring that you have to think
                  up shit like this?





                         
                  I had Maxie Dean on the phone!
                  Darling, Dad's found a way to make
                  some money here while I relax, so
                  scram!






                         
                  And your mother is going to kill
                  you when she sees that you cut
                  holes in her $300 sheets.  You
                  provoke her you know.  I mean she
                  can be an unreasonable bitch.  But
                  you do provoke her.









                  God, this is so corny.  Have we
                  been reduced to this?  Sheets?


                  Think of them as death shrouds.
                  And the moaning is important.
                  Really moan!
                         
                  Practice, practice, practice.









                  Deep breath... and...









                  Gross!  How can he stand that
                  woman?
                         
                  Hey, cut it out!  I'm a child!
                  For God sakes!









                  I feel really stupid.


                  It's not stupid.  We're ghosts.
                  Do you want this woman for
                  breakfast for 125 years?  Moan
                  louder!

















                  Sick!  Sexual perversion!  If
                  you're going to do weird sexual
                  stuff you ought to stay in your
                  bedroom, okay?







                  Holy cow!  No feet!











                         
                  A... Are you the guys who're
                  hiding out in the attic?


                         
                  We're ghosts.




                         
                  W... What do you look like under
                  there?











                  Aren't you scared?


                  I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren.
                  Those are sheets.  Are you gross
                  under there?  Are you "Night of
                  the Living Dead" under there?
                  Like all bloody veins and pus?


                  What?


                  "Night of the Living Dead?"  It's
                  a movie.


                         (pulling off
                          the sheet)
                  If I had seen a ghost at your age,
                  I would have been frightened out
                  of my wits.


                  You're not gross.  Why were you
                  wearing a sheet?


                  We're practicing.


                  You can actually see us?  Without
                  the sheets?


                  Is this like a trick question?


                  Tell the truth.


                         
                  Of course I can see you.


                  Nobody else can.


                  I'm wearing contacts... Also I
                  read through the "Handbook for the
                  Recently Deceased."  It says that
                  live people ignore the strange and
                  unusual... I, myself, am strange
                  and unusual.


                         
                  You look like a regular girl to me.





                  You read our book?  Could you
                  follow it?




                  Why are you creeping around
                  Delia's bedroom?


                  We were trying to scare your
                  mother.


                  Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive
                  about being related to reptiles.




                         
                  You can't scare her.  She's
                  sleeping with Prince Valium
                  tonight.
                         
                  I stole the key to your attic, you
                  know.




                  Maybe we better talk.









                  You did this?  You carved all
                  these little figures and houses
                  and things?


                         
                  I certainly did.  I'd finish it
                  too, but... I don't get out much.


                  And this used to be your house, I
                  bet.  Why do you want to scare
                  everybody?


                  We want to frighten you away.
                         
                  So that you'll move out.


                  You don't know the Deetz's very
                  well, do you?  My father bought
                  this place.  He never walks away
                  from equity.  Why don't you leave?


                  We can't.  We haven't left the
                  house since the funeral.


                  Funeral.  God, you guys really are
                  dead!
                         
                  What was it like?  The funeral.
                  Did you cry?


                  We weren't there.  The handbook
                  says funerals aren't for the dead.


                  God, if this is true this is
                  amazing!  I kinda like it up
                  here.  Can I visit you sometimes?


                  Well, I don't know... We don't get
                  many visitors.


                  You know you're really a pretty
                  girl.




                  Lydia!


                  I better go...


                  Wait... I don't think it would be
                  a very good idea if you told your
                  parents that we're up here.


                  Unless you think it would scare
                  them off.




                         
                  You tell them that we are
                  desperate horrible ghoulish
                  creatures who will stop at nothing
                  to get back our house.


                         (looks him up
                          and down)
                  Wait a minute, what if this is a
                  dream?  Can you do any tricks to
                  prove I'm not dreaming?




                         
                  Well, if you are real ghosts, you
                  better get another routine, those
                  sheets suck!























                  Lydia!  Lydia!  My hands are
                  shredded from doing the laundry,
                  and now I have to deal with your
                  vandalism!









                  Lydia, honest to God I'm going to
                  kill you.  I'm having a party
                  tonight.  I'm cooking, I can't get
                  servants.  Do I need angst?  No, I
                  certainly do not!




                         
                  You owe me three-hundred bucks,
                  Lydia!  Don't go running to your
                  father, you worm.








                  Dad.  Do you believe me?


                  Yes.  Except when you creep around
                  in your mother's --


                  Stepmother's...


                  ... sheets.


                  Well this is... I mean, this is
                  the weirdest --


                  Lydia, I don't know what it is
                  with you and these pratical
                  jokes, but --


                  This is not a joke!  That sheet
                  was full of ghosts.





                         
                  No feet.




                         
                  You don't believe me.  That sheet
                  was full of ghosts.  They live
                  here.




                         
                  Very clever, Lydia.  Now would you
                  please -- I'll tell you what... I
                  know!  You're bored, right?  You
                  take that camera and your bike
                  and photograph every building in
                  town.  Don't tell anyone what it's
                  for...
                         (handing her a
                          wad of bills)
                  Here, take some cash and go do
                  it.  How's that?  You want to
                  stretch, don't you?






                         
                  Look at the size of these lots...




                  What is this guy doing?












                  I can't believe you are doing this
                  to me!  Ghosts.  I am giving a
                  dinner party for seven people
                  tonight.  Otho has agreed to come
                  back for the demolition of the
                  attic.  My agent, Bernard, is
                  bringing some woman who writes for
                  "Art in America."  In fact, no one
                  here tonight has not been in
                  "Vanity Fair."  Except you.


                         
                  I told them you were too mean to
                  be afraid.


                  Don't you dare talk to others
                  about me.  I'm an artist!  The
                  only thing that scares me is being
                  embarrassed in front of my
                  friends.  Do you know how hard it
                  is to get civilized people to set
                  foot in this part of Connecticut?
                  Not a solitary word of this
                  pubescent tripe to anyone.








                  Lydia's trying, but they don't
                  believe her.


                  She's got photos, Barbara.


                  Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!


                  This is different.  Eventually
                  she'll take someone to the attic.
                  And then what?  We've got to try
                  to contact this guy Betelmyer.  We
                  gotta get some help, hon.











                  Adam!




                  I didn't do that one... Hmmm.


                  It's him.  Look... Betelgeuse...
                  Betelgeuse...





                  Go ahead... third time's a charm.


                         
                  Betelgeuse!













                  What happened?


                  Three times.  Powerful number.


                         (standing in front
                          of grave)
                  Bet... el... geuse.  What an
                  awful name.  I thought it was like
                  -- you know.  The juice of
                  beetles.




                         
                  Where is he?  What do we do?





                  Has anything been simple so far?
                  From the look of the shovel, we
                  dig.


                  Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.
                  My nails keep getting longer.
                  I'll break them.











                  It's about time.




                          "BETELGEUSE"


                  I guess we open it.


                  Maybe we should knock first?







































                  All right.  Who are you?


                  We're...


                  You're the dead.


                  Aren't you dead?


                  Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a
                  businessman.  I'm the man what
                  am.  Beeetel Jooose!  Who
                  do I gotta kill?


                  You don't kill anyone.


                  Just get some people out of our
                  house.


                  Bio busting.  I love it.  Who do
                  I gotta kill?  Family -- right?
                  Obnoxious, I bet.
                         
                  Mommie, daddy, piglets.


                  Just one daughter.


                  Hey you've been on Saturn!
                         (brushing yellow dust
                          off her)
                  I hate those Sandworms!  Yecchhh!
                  I've lost a lot of buddies to
                  Sandworms.
                         
                  So a daughter?  She got good legs?
                  God I love a young leg.





                  She's only fourteen...


                  ... acts like she's thirty-five.


                         
                  How does she feel about short old
                  men with dirty ears?





                  So you, the dead, want me, the
                  undead, to throw the live guys --
                  Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who
                  might not mind a tumble with an
                  older guy, out into the cold?
                  Even though they have paid hard
                  casharoonie for your dump?


                  But... the Deetzes are destroying
                  our house.


                         
                  You Maitlands are the backbone of
                  the afterlife.  So what's my cut?


                  Can you scare them off?




                  Me, scary?  You be the judge.








                         
                  Honey.  Let's go.


                  Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need
                  help.


                  No, we don't.  We can work
                  something out ourselves.  We just
                  have to try harder.


                  Hold on.  Let's not be squeamish,
                  missy.  You rang my bell, you
                  gotta lick the pump.  I'm rolling!







                  Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at
                  your service.  You be the judge.
                  I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.


                  Home.  Home.  Home!







                  You fresh corpse creeps!  Who do
                  you think you are?... Walking
                  away from a professional?

















                  Honey, I think that was a mistake.


                  I am not going to expose that
                  little girl to that... pervert
                  down there.


                  How'd you do that?


                         
                  Just a hunch... remember things
                  come in threes -- three times in,
                  three times out... I'm getting the
                  hang of this stuff.


                  I think we really pissed him off.


                  I don't care...


                  But we let him out.


                  I've changed my mind... I feel
                  really confident.  We're getting
                  better at this stuff.  We can
                  scare them off ourselves --
                  tonight!  I've got an idea.
                  You're going to love it... I'm
                  going to hate it.









                  Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure
                  seemed mad.


                         
                  Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I
                  go!





















                         
                  Well, darling, you can only have a
                  hysterectomy once, so why don't you
                  tell us what you really went into
                  the hospital for last week?  Or dare
                  I ask, is that a nose "nouveau?"


                         (privately; to
                          Otho)
                  Otho, you've got to help me get
                  Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal
                  that could make all of us very
                  comfortable.


                  He's a cloven-hooved beast!


                  He's your cousin.


                  I am ashamed to say he is.  Look,
                  nothing short of giving away free
                  sacks of money would get him up
                  here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget
                  it.  You can't get her out of
                  Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
                         (still on Beryl's
                          case)
                  I just hope it wasn't yet another of
                  your dreary suicide attempts.  You
                  know what they say about people who
                  who commit suicide.  In the afterlife,
                  they become civil servants.


                  Otho!  I didn't know you were into
                  the supernatural?


                  Of course you remember!  After my
                  stint with the living theatre.  I
                  was one of New York City's leading
                  paranormal researchers until the
                  bottom dropped out of the business
                  in '72.


                         (sick to death of
                          this blowhard)
                  Paranormal... Is that what they're
                  calling your kind now?







                         (a threat; quietly
                          to Lydia)
                  Don't you dare.


                  I saw some ghosts.




                         
                  Lydia tried to play a most
                  amusing joke on me this afternoon.


                  It wasn't a joke.


                  Tried to convince me that this
                  house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids.
                  Kids!  I love them.




                  By ghosts?


                  By what else?


                         
                  In sheets yet.  Designer sheets.
                  They --





                  I propose a toast to our intrepid
                  friends.  Who braved the
                  expressway and fourteen toll
                  booths to visit us.  May your
                  buildings go condo.





                  Yechhh!








                  Thunderbird wine?  My God, Delia,
                  don't you even have a Safeway up
                  here?


                         (horrified; but
                          recovering)
                  Joke Joke!  Charles get the good
                  wine and I'll serve the shrimp.
                  It's a joke.












                         
                  Lydia switched wines.  Charles --
                  if you do not agree right now, to
                  boarding school, you can forget
                  having what you call sex -- ever
                  again in your natural lifetime.
















                  Now, Lydia... Favor us about your
                  ghosts.


                  No!  Do not encourage this
                  little... person.


                  Oh, Delia, lighten up!


                  She's been without therapy up here
                  and I will not allow her to
                  ruin...














                  "If I didn't care, More than
                  words could say."








                  "If my every prayer, did not
                  begin and end with just your
                  name."




                  For God's sake, stop me...




                  "I could not be true to you
                  beyond compare."









                         
                  "Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop."


                  "If I didn't care... for you..."


                  "Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop."









































                  We did it!


                  Let's watch 'em scatter.











                  Any minute now.  They'll all run
                  screaming.







                  Your Ink Spots were wonderful!




                  And your shrimp was remarkable.


                  My shrimp?  I did the wine.
                  Didn't you do the sushi?


                  N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.


                  Who did the?






                         (from outside the
                          door)
                  It's me.  Lydia.





                         
                  They'd like for you to come
                  downstairs.  Delia says you can
                  pick any sheets you want.










                  It does indicate a marvelously
                  urbane sense of humor on the part
                  of these ghosts -- that they
                  actually appear in sheets!


                  We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn
                  here, a very sophisticated pair.  We
                  must protect them, treat them with
                  respect.  Nurture them.


                  People will pay big money for
                  this.  Right, Grace?


                         
                  Charles, I want to know why you
                  didn't tell me about this --


                         (now changing her
                          tune)
                  We were waiting for proof.
                  Lydia's photographs...




                         
                  What are you all talking about?
                  We... we just got a little drunk,
                  that's all.


                  No matter how drunk you get, you
                  cannot sound like the Ink Spots.
                         
                  Charles, this is it!  You can get
                  Maxie Dean up here now.




                  His wife Sarah loves the
                  supernatural.  I did a reading for
                  her just last week.  Told her her
                  jowls would tighten soon.  I mean
                  she will make him sprint up here in
                  his helicopter if you can produce
                  ghosts for her.


                  The "Enquirer" has offered fifty
                  thousand dollars for absolute
                  proof of life after death.  I'll
                  send them over.


                  I'm Delia's agent!  I've lost
                  money for years on her work.  If
                  anything actually happened here,
                  I'll handle it, thank you.  But
                  not until I see some real proof.





                  They don't want to come down.


                  Why not?





                  I think the reason is they were
                  trying to scare you, and you
                  didn't get scared --


                  Of course we weren't scared.
                         
                  Just a little startled.  One of
                  those shrimp dropped down my
                  Kamali.





                         
                  Total collective hallucination.


                  I was a little tipsie.


                  This was not a hallucination,
                  people.  This was real, really
                  totally real.


                  Of course, they were rather
                  spectacular effects -- for
                  Connecticut, I mean.


                  All presences have a home space.  A
                  place where they live, so to speak.
                  Where do they hide out?


                         
                  The attic.


                  The attic room is locked --


                  They're ghosts.  They do what they
                  want.


                  Fabulous!  Otho Fenlock's "Locked
                  Door" ghosts!  Probably committed
                  suicide up there -- hanging like
                  beeves from the rafters.  I'm
                  totally enchanted.




                  Delia, you are a flake.  You have
                  always been a flake.  I'm packing
                  up and going back to the tricks of
                  the city.  That I can manage.  If
                  you must frighten people, do it
                  with your sculpture.




                  Wait!  I'm going to get to the
                  bottom of this!  Lydia, is this
                  some high-tech trick of yours?  I
                  want you to take us up there tout
                  sweet!







                         
                  Shhh.  They're in there?  God,
                  they live like animals.  This is
                  where they've been hiding out?





                         
                  All right, you dead people!  Come
                  on out, or we'll break down this
                  door and drag you out on the ropes
                  you hanged yourself with!


                  Shhhh.  They didn't commit
                  suicide.


                  It doesn't matter.
                  What matters is I've got a roomful
                  of guests down there, who think
                  I'm a fraud.
                         
                  I am going to teach you something
                  here Lydia.  You've got to take
                  the right tone in things like
                  this, or people -- whether they're
                  dead or alive -- people will walk
                  all over you.
                         
                  Come on out, or I will make death
                  so miserable that you will wish
                  you had never lived!











                         
                  So where are they, Lydia?




                         
                  Answer your mother.


                  Listen, you guys.  These ghosts
                  are really nice people.  I think
                  we scared them off.  Let's just
                  leave them alone.  Okay?





                  It's the whole damn town.





                  Look at that detail!


                  Look at the tiny figures.


                  Look at all that parking!


                  Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.


                  They're not here, Lydia?





                  I have never been so
                  embarrassed... They haven't gone
                  for good, have they?




                         
                  Everyone out of there.  If they're
                  in there somewhere, I don't want
                  to scare them away.  Come on now,
                  stay out of there.  We've got work
                  to do.

































                  Juno, help!  Juno!











                  Lydia, I will never forgive you
                  for embarrassing me in front of my
                  social inferiors.  You help us
                  with these ghosts or you'll be
                  sorry.


                  I'm sorry already.


                         
                  Now, let's get back to business.  I
                  I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah
                  up here immediately.  I can make
                  history here!  I'm going to turn
                  this sleepy little backward town
                  into a leading supernatural
                  research center... and amusement
                  park.


                         
                  I cannot believe this.


                  Delia will cook...




                         
                  I'll bring the wine... and the
                  business plan.  And Lydia --
                  you'll bring the ghosts.


                         
                  I can't bring the ghosts.  They're
                  not here!


                  ... Otho, could you actually... do
                  something with them?


                         (pats the handbook
                          under his coat)
                  Perhaps... if I were properly
                  motivated...


                  That's slavery and murder.  You
                  don't know them.  They're nice
                  people!


















































                  We've come for your daughter,
                  Chuck!



















                  Betelgeuse!  Betelgeuse!
                  Betelgeuse!























                  RRRatt shit!







                  I hate you!  I thought you were my
                  friends.


                  No, wait!




                         
                  I hate all of you!









                  Great choice we've got here.  We
                  get to spend the next century
                  either hanging out that window or
                  doing parlor tricks.





                  Maybe they'll leave now.  That
                  snake was a pretty nasty customer.


                  He might have hurt somebody.


                  But he didn't.  We've got him
                  where we want him.
















                  You pansy-assed cretins!  How dare
                  you do that to me.  I coulda
                  finished the job!








                         (thin and pip-
                          ing voice)
                  Why did you stop me?


                  I don't like Charles Deetz
                  particularly, but you could have
                  killed him.


                  Hey, I've been bottled up for six
                  hundred years.  Every dog has his
                  day.  This is my town.  I need a
                  night to howl.


                  This is my town.


                  You wish!  I nearly scored with
                  that little blonde.  I need me a
                  short little queen.











                  You leave her alone, you horrid
                  little prick!


















                  Go ahead.  Make my millenium!








                  This burg got a cathouse?  I'm
                  getting anxious if you know what I
                  mean.  Six hundred years and all.












                  Adam!  Why did you build a whore
                  house?  Have you ever been to...?


                  I didn't --


















                  God, you have got her steaming
                  now.







                  The whorehouse was my idea.  I
                  want Betelgeuse out of the
                  picture!  We've got some serious
                  talking to do.


                  About what?


                  You people have really screwed
                  up!  I received word that you
                  allowed yourselves to be
                  photographed.  And you let
                  Betelgeuse out and didn't put him
                  back, and you let Otho get ahold
                  of the handbook.


                  Handbook?  When...?


                         
                  Never trust the living!  We cannot
                  have a routine haunting like yours
                  provide incontrovertible visual
                  proof of existence beyond death.


                  Well, we didn't know --







                  Hey, Coach, where's the men's
                  room?


                         
                  I'm not your coach.  He survived.


                  You don't need a men's room.
                  You're not no man no more.  But
                  Coach, let me get this -- What's
                  our curfew over here?





                         
                  I'll be right back.









                  I feel like we've been at war,
                  Charles.


                  At least insofar as we have our
                  first casualty.  Me.


                  Otho'll know what to do.


                  What's he going to do?  Viciously
                  rearrange their environment?


                  Otho knows just as much about the
                  supernatural as he knows about
                  interior design.


                  Let's hope he knows how to produce
                  those damn ghosts for Max and
                  Sarah... Because I've bought
                  options on property all over town.
                  I need Max's financing...


                  Just don't tell Lydia.


                  Why not?


                  I think she's in with them.
















                  I am alone.




                         
                  I am utterly... alone.  You have
                  sealed my fate with your betrayal.
                  I can no longer stand to be used
                  like a puppet between two
                  deceitful worlds.  By the time you
                  read this, I will be gone, having
                  jumped off...




                         
                  ... having plummeted off the
                  Winter River Bridge.  Then you
                  will know that I am no longer a
                  toy in your petty feuds.  Goodbye,
                  Lydia.




























                  Are you here?





                         
                  Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come
                  for the last time?
                         (laying note on
                          table)
                  Where are you?  Barb...


                  They're dead.




                         
                  Think small.  I'm talking to you.












                  Cookie, they are dead, dead,
                  deadski.


                  Of course they're dead.  They're
                  ghosts.


                  No, I mean they've gone.
                  Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.


                  Where'd they go?


                  The happy hunting ground.  Who
                  cares?


                  Are you a spirit too?


                  Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh.
                  Listen, cookie, I've been trapped
                  in this burg for hundreds of
                  years.  All I want is to get out.


                  I want to get in.


                  You do?  Over here?  On my side?


                  I think so.


                         
                  Well, yes, of course.  It's great
                  over here.  You'll meet all the
                  greats.  James Dean.  Sid
                  Vicious...


                  Well, it can't be any worse than
                  my life here.


                         (sinister, encouraging
                          her)
                  That's right.  They treat you like
                  scum, I bet?


                  Yeah.


                  I can't help you from this side,
                  but here's how we do it.  So
                  simple.  Say my name three
                  times.  That's all.  I'll be all
                  yours.  Then I'll bring you over
                  here in style.


                  I... I don't know what your name is.


                  Minor problem.  The rules.  I
                  can't tell it to you.  But.. do
                  you know how to play charades?


                  Yes.


                  Of course you do.




                  Two words.




                         
                  First word.




                         
                  Three syllables.


                  No, dummy.  Two.


                  Your fingers are so small I can't
                  see them.  First word -- two
                  syllables.




                         
                  I don't know what that signal
                  means.


                  It means look behind you, bimbo.









                  Beetle!


                  Good girrrl!





                         
                  Second word.  Be careful.









                  Breakfast?  Orange?




                  Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle
                  fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit Battle?
                  Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?


                  Good thing you are a beautiful
                  kid.  You are dumb!




                  I am not!  Beetle... Juice?


                         
                  That's it!


                  Your name is Beetle Juice?  Yecch!
                  That's as bad as Deeelia Deeetz.


                  It's spelled different, but
                  basically... Now you said it
                  twice, just one more time.  And
                  I'll be free.
                         
                  And then you'll be free.











                  God, you're anatomically correct!


                  Just say it.


                         (recognizing something
                          about him)
                  You were the snake!  Right?  I
                  know.  It was you.


                  You've got to say it!


                  No I don't.  I don't take orders
                  from Smurfs.


                  How'd you like to be married to...
                  the King...?




                         
                  ... Elvis?...
                         
                  You know, ever since he came over
                  he and I have been just like this.
                         
                  I can arrange it.  Just say my
                  name one more time.




                  No, No... I need to talk to
                  Barbara.




                  Well, cookie, just say my name.  I
                  can get her.
                         (rubbing his horny little
                          hands together)
                  That and so much more...




                  Who else did you say is over
                  there?







                  Yes... or no?  Do you want the
                  Deetzes out or in?


                  Out.


                  What about Betelgeuse?


                  Forget him.  He'll remain with his
                  whores until someone calls him.
                  You need to worry about people like
                  Otho.  There are a lot of
                  phony trance mediums.  They
                  usually can't make the formulas
                  work, but if Otho stumbles on the
                  right words in that handbook... he
                  could hurt you.  As in --
                  exorcism.




                         
                  In plain English -- that's death
                  for the dead.  I don't care what
                  it takes, just get them out of
                  there now.  It's not pretty, but
                  -- that's death!




                         
                  Wait a minute.  Let's see what
                  you're going to do...




                         
                  ... to scare her.  I want to make
                  sure it's not some silly parlor
                  trick.




                  I'll do the hard part, hon.









                  Not bad.  Not bad.  Now you?  Go
                  ahead.








                         
                  Okay.  You look great!  Now go
                  clean house.  And don't forget the
                  photographs and the damned
                  handbook.











                  Coach!  Coach, I don't think we
                  survived the crash!














                  Adam.  I can't do it.  I like that
                  little girl.


                  It's too late.  Sometimes things
                  just work out this way.  We have
                  to, honey.


                  No we don't.  We can rebel or
                  something.  We'll just stay up
                  there in our room.  I'll read, you
                  can build on the model.  Come on.





                  Wait.  We can't, honey.  Our
                  house...




                  I want to be with Lydia!










                  Okay.  Beetle... J...




                  !  Lydia, stop!





                  No, don't say it!


                  Say it!  Rat shit!





















                  You lily-livered bleeding hearts!


                  I'm so sorry we frightened you.
                  What were you doing?


                  He... Beetle Jui...




                         
                  He said if I let him out he would
                  take me over to the other side to
                  find you.


                  No, Lydia, we're dead.


                  I want to be dead, too.


                         
                  No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?


                         (after a pause,
                          dramatically
                          but for real)
                  Life is just... unliveable...







                  Lydia, believe me... we know...
                  all the hard stuff is the same
                  over here.  You're going to be who
                  you are... whether you're alive or
                  dead... and over here -- it's...
                  It's flat... there's no food, no
                  colors... you can't smell the
                  flowers.
                         
                  If we knew then what we know
                  now... we'd have been more
                  careful...


                         (in the style of the
                          dead receptionist)
                  ... we wouldn't have had our
                  little accident.




                  So never let Beetlejuice out --
                  never.  Besides...
                         
                  We're thinking about letting
                  everyone stay... you and your
                  father and mother can stay too.


                         (smiles and says
                          slowly)
                  Step... mother.























                  What is going on?


                  Really.  I don't know.




                         
                  I really don't.  I'll go find out.




                  Be careful.




















                  -- In short, I've got options to
                  buy enough of Main Street to
                  control the city council for a
                  hundred years.  And at the prices
                  I'm talking about, if it all fell
                  apart tomorrow, we just move out and
                  sell to the Arabs and we still come
                  out... I've talked to Ed Cornwall
                  about a wax museum, here... in
                  Thanksgiving Park... Ed's the man
                  who made the talking Jesse Jackson
                  statue.
                  And I've got a museum dedicated to
                  50 Great Moments in the Paranormal
                  -- and parenthetically, D-Con wants
                  to the right to start an insect zoo
                  here in the old hardware store.
                         
                  Lydia, did you finally decide to
                  join us?




                  Honey, I am just finishing the first
                  phase presentation about our little
                  project here.  Then we'll take a
                  stretch and invite our friends... to meet
                  your friends.






                  Are they here yet?


                  Yes, Charles, let's cut the
                  bullcorn.  We're here to see
                  ghosts.  This whole ghost town
                  museum and such like follows a
                  train, if you've got the engine...
                  so let's see your goddamned engine.




                  They're... not here anymore.


                         
                  Nonsense, every time she says
                  that, the paint peels, and some
                  wild creature tries to kill us.


                         
                  We've got these pictures, Lydia.


                  No, really... they said they might
                  come back and all of us could live
                  in peace if you agreed not to
                  tease them or make them do silly
                  tricks.





                  She's become a little emotional
                  about all this.  No counseling up
                  here.  But we aren't relying on
                  her.  No, we rely on
                  professionals.  We have... Otho.





                  Are they still here, Otho?




                  Are they still here, Otho?


                  Oh, they're still here.  They're
                  just not showing up.


                  They're probably guilty about what
                  they did to me.


                  Not these people!  They are
                  ruthless!


                  I don't care from guilt.  I just
                  want to see them.


                  Otho, can you do it?


                  It's tricky, but I think I can
                  handle it.




                  No!





                  Wait a minute!  What am I worried
                  about?  Otho, you can't even
                  change a tire!


                         
                  I'll need something personal of
                  theirs.


                  You'll have to go to the Goodwill.















                         
                  You know, I've been thinking.  I
                  could teach Lydia to sew.


                  Little black party dresses?


                         
                  Ah, Adam, you don't know anything
                  about little girls.  She's just...
                  missed out on some love, that's
                  all...


                         
                  Let's see if she can get my model
                  back.


                  You can build another one... with
                  her.





                         
                  Come here, I want to talk to you.








                  I'm deeply sentimental about...
                  weddings.








                         
                  Their wedding clothes.


                         
                  Their wedding clothes.




                  The "words".










                  Hands vermillion / start of five
                  bright cotillion / raven's dive
                  nightshades promise / spirit's strive,
                  to the living / let now the dead...
                  come alive.




                         
                  Doo wah.













                  We've been given a gift here,
                  honey.  A real live little girl.
                  She likes us a lot.  She needs
                  us.  Maybe that's why we died so
                  young, to keep us from getting
                  so... attached to things.  The
                  house, antiques, your model.  Look
                  at us.  We didn't have room for
                  anyone.


                         
                  What makes you think she likes me?

































                  As sudden thunder / Pierces the night;
                  As magic wonder / Mad affright
                  Rives asunder / Man's delight:
                  Our ghost, our corpse and we
                  Rise to be.











                  Stop it!


                  Shhhh!




                  Adam.  Adam.


                         
                  As flies the lizard / Serpent fell;
                  As goblin vizard, / At the spell
                  Of pale wizard, / Sinks to hell;
                  The buried, dead, and slain...
                  Rise again.








                  Barbara!  Barbara?  Ba...

























                  What's happening to them?


                  I don't know.


                  Are they suffering?


                         
                  They're dying.


                  They're already dead.  They can't
                  feel a thing.












                  Where are you?  Help us!  Please.
                  Betelgeuse!















                  So... You're ready for me now?


                  You've got to help them.


                  Can you help me?


                         
                  ... I will.


                  Then I'll help them.  For a price.




                  W... What is it?


                         (his words echo
                          horribly
                  Be... my... queen!

                  Betelgeuse...

















                  Betelgeuse!








                  All right, that's enough.  Can you
                  stop this now?




                         
                  Otho?


                  It's too late, Charles.  I'm
                  sorry.

                  deserve a rest.









                  Well, we'll get back to them after
                  they recover from their flight.








                         
                  My God, what ugly wall dressing.
                  Who is responsible for all this

                  Hellooo!  How's school?


                         (not particularly
                          interested)
                  It's okay.  How's the dirt
                  business?


                  Well, I'm expecting a call from
                  your parents.  I have some news
                  for them.




                  Tell them I'll call them tonight.







                  Don't forget the balls, Ernie.









                  What do you mean no?  After all
                  I've done for you.  I don't do
                  this for my health you know.











                  I have here a bona fide offer of
                  $250,000.00 for that dump.















                         
                  It's Mrs. Butterworth again.




                  Listen to me, Jane.  We don't want
                  anyone looking at the house.  We
                  don't want it painted, the yard
                  mowed, the trees trimmed, nor do
                  we want it termite inspected.
                  It's not for sale.







                  Well.  Okay for now.  When will
                  you sell it?





                         
                  Never, honey.  Never.




                         
                  Some people never know when to
                  leave things the way they are.










                  What time is it?


                  3:30 I guess.


                  Give or take a year.







                  Did you get the paint?


                  I got it.  And I took pictures of
                  the new church for you, too.


                  How'd you do on the science test?




                         
                  It was gross.  They wanted me to
                  dissect a frog.  I told them no
                  way.  I said it was against my
                  religion.  I got a C.




                  How did you do on the math test?




                  We studied all day yesterday.
                  Don't tell me...


                  I got an A!




                         
                  So can I?


                         
                  Uh-uh.  Only if you got above a C
                  on science.


                  Oh, go on...


                  Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You
                  never got an A in science in your
                  life!


                  All right.





                         
                  Okay.








                  "When a man loves a woman.
                  He can't keep his mind on nothin' else."





                  Oooooo.  Hummm oooooo.


                  He'd change the world for the good
                  thing he's found.  When a main
                  needs a woman, He cain't keep his
                  mind on nothin' else.  If she's
                  bad, he won't see it, she can do
                  no wrong.
