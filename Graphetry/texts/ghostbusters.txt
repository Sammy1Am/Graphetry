					Final Shooting Script
				Last revised October 7, 1983



























































				
			Hello?  Is anybody there?














				
			All right!  Who's there?  Lyle? Is that you?






















"Venkman Burn In Hell!"  It looks like it's been written in blood.


			Now I'm going to turn over the next card and
			I want you to concentrate and tell me what
			you think it is.



















			All right.  What is it?


				
			A square?


				
			Good guess -- but no.








			Now just clear your mind and tell me what
			you see.




				
			Is it a star?


				
			It is a star!  That's great.  You're very
			good.





				
			Now think.






			Circle?


			Close -- but definitely wrong.




			Ready?
				(she nods and he turns up
				the triangle card)
			What is it?


				
			Ummm -- figure eight?


				
			Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not
			cheating on me here, are you?


				
			No.  They're just coming to me.


			Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.





			Nervous?


			Yes.  I don't like this.


			Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?


				
			Two wavy lines?


				
			Sorry.  This isn't your day.




				
			Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.


			You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we
			paying you for this?


			Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to
			give me electric shocks.  What are you
			trying to prove?


			I'm studying the effect of negative
			reinforcement on ESP ability.


			I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!


			Then my theory was correct.




				
			Keep the five bucks.  I've had it!




			Well, I guess some people have it and some
			don't.


				
			Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?


			Definitely.  I think you may be a very
			gifted telepath.










			Drop everything, Venkman.  We got one.









			Excuse me for a minute.
				
			Ray, I'm right in the middle of something
			here.  Can you come back in about an hour?


				(excited, but hushed and
				confidential)
			Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main
			branch of the New York Public Library on
			Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a
			free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso
			apparition.  It blew books from shelves at
			twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some
			poor librarian.


				
			Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you
			should get down there right away and check
			it out.  Let me know what happens.


				
			No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler
			went down there and took some PKE readings.
			Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the
			needle.  We're close this time. I can feel
			it.





				
			Okay.  Just give me a second here.
				(he crosses back to the
				Coed)
			I have to leave now but if you've got some
			time I'd like you to come back this evening
			and do some more work with me.


			Eight o'clock?


				
			I was just going to say "eight."  You're
			fantastic!









			Spengler and I have charted every psychic
			occurrence in the Tri-State area for the
			past two years.  The graph we came up with
			definitely points to something big.


			Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I
			think you've really gone around the bend on
			this ghost stuff.  You've been running your
			ass off for two years checking out every
			schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's
			had an experience.  And what have you seen?


			What do you mean by "seen?"


			Looked at with your eyes.


			Well, I was at an unexplained multiple
			high-altitude rockfall once.


			Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray.
			I think you've been spending too much time
			with Spengler.











			Egon?





			Egon!





			Oh!  You're here.


			What have you got, Egon?


			Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big.
			There's definitely something here.


			Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time
			you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do
			you remember that?







				
			Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head
			Librarian.  Are you the men from the
			University?


			Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.


				
			Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if
			we could take care of this quickly and quietly.


			One thing at a time.  We don't even know
			what it is yet.







			I don't remember seeing any legs, but it
			definitely had arms because it reached for
			me.


				
			Arms!  Great!  I can't wait to get a look
			at this thing.




				
			All right, miss.  Have you or has any member
			of your family ever been diagnosed
			schizophrenic or mentally incompetent?


			Well, my uncle thought he was St. Jerome.


				
			I'll call that a big "yes."
				
			Do you yourself habitually use drugs,
			stimulants or alcohol?


			No.


			I thought not.  And one last thing.  Are you
			currently menstruating?


				
			What's that got to do with it?


				
			Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!






				
			It's moving!

























			Nice.
				
			Hello...





			It's here.


















				
			What is it?


			It looks like a big pair of breasts and a
			pot belly.







			It's a woman.





				
			I told you it's real.


				
			What do we do now?


				
			I don't know.  Talk to it.


				(nods in agreement then
				hesitates)
			What do I say?


			Anything!  Just make contact.


				(takes a deep breath, then
				addresses the specter)
			Hey, Lady?
				(the apparition turns and
				seems to look right past
				them)
			Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?
				
				
			This is not working.  Think of something else.


				
			Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do.
			Stay close.  I have a plan.





				
			Okay, now do exactly as I say. Everybody
			ready?


			Ready.


			Okay...
				
			GET HER!!!











				
			QUIET!












				
			Did you see it?  What was it?


			We'll get back to you.







				
			"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You
			call that science?


				
			I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't
			it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a
			first.  You know what this could mean to the
			University?


				
			Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the
			microchip.  They'll probably throw out the
			entire engineering department and turn their
			building over to us.  We're probably the
			first serious scientists to ever molest a
			dead old lady.


				(consulting his
				mini-computer)
			I wouldn't say the experience was completely
			wasted.  Based on these new readings, I
			think we have an excellent chance of
			actually catching a ghost and holding it
			indefinitely.





				
			Then we were right!  This is great.  And if
			the ionization rate is constant for all
			ectoplasmic entities, I think we could
			really kick ass -- in the spiritual sense.




			Spengler, are you serious about actually
			catching a ghost?


			I'm always serious.


				(his mind reeling at the
				possibilities)
			Wow!







			Egon, I take back everything I ever said
			about you.  Take this.
				
			You earned it.








				
			If you guys are right, if we can actually
			trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I
			could win the Nobel Prize.


				
			If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me.
			We're doing all the hard research and
			designing the equipment.


			Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never
			would've met if not for me.  That's got to
			be worth something.














				
			I trust you're moving us to a better space
			somewhere on campus.


			No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board
			of Regents has decided to terminate your
			grant.  You are to vacate these premises
			immediately.


			This is preposterous!  I demand an
			explanation.


			Fine.  This University will no longer
			continue any funding of any kind for your
			group's activities.


			But why?  The students love us!


			Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of
			science is to serve mankind.  You, however,
			seem to regard science as some kind of
			"dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the
			worst kind of popular tripe, your methods
			are sloppy and your conclusions are highly
			questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr.
			Venkman, and you have no place in this
			department or in this University.


			I see.


				
			You said you floored 'em at the Regents'
			meeting.


				
			Ray, I apologize.
				
			I guess my confidence in the Regents was
			misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.


			It could be worse, Dr. Venkman.  They took
			the astronomer Phileas and staked his head
			to the town gate.






				
			This is like a major disgrace.  Forget
			M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't
			touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.


			You're always so worried about your
			reputation.  We don't need the University.
			Einstein did his best stuff while he was
			working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop
			progress.


				
			Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I
			liked the University.  They gave us money,
			they gave us the facilities and we didn't
			have to produce anything!  I've worked in
			the private sector.  They expect results.
			You've never been out of college.  You don't
			know what it's like out there.


				
			Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life
			happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call
			it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were
			destined to get kicked out of there.


			For what purpose?


				
			To go into business for ourselves.




			I don't know.  That costs money.  And the
			ecto-containment system we have in mind will
			require a load of bread to capitalize.
			Where would we get the money?









			You'll never regret this, Ray.


				
			My parents left me that house, I was born
			there.


			You're not going to lose the house.
			Everybody has three mortgages these days.


			But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't
			even bargain with the guy.


			
			Just for your information, Ray, the interest
			payments alone for the first five years come
			to over $75,000.


			Will you guys relax?  We are on the
			threshold of establishing the indispensable
			defense science of the next decade -
			Professional Paranormal Investigations and
			Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone
			will make us wealthy beyond your wildest
			dreams.


			But most people are afraid to even report
			these things.


			Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
















			Besides this, you've got another substantial
			work area on the ground floor, office space,
			sleeping quarters and showers on the next
			floor, and you have your full kitchen on the
			top level.  It's 10,000 square feet total.






			It's 9,642.55 square feet.




			What is he -- your accountant?






				
			Wow!  Does this pole still work?


				(considering but not
				wanting to appear too
				eager)
			This might do ... I don't know ... it just
			seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper,
			don't you think?  We're trying to keep our
			costs down.  You know how it is when you're
			starting a new company.


			Yes, I know.  What are you calling your
			business?


			Ghostbusters.


			Oh, well, this place is perfect for it.





























			Oh, Dana, it's you ...


				
			Hi, Louis.


			... I thought it was the drug store.


			Are you sick, Louis?





			Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some
			more vitamins.  I see you were exercising.
			So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and
			played it back at high speed so it only took
			ten minutes and I got a really good workout.
			You wanna have a mineral water with me?


			No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've
			been rehearsing all morning.


			Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have
			plenty of mineral water and other nutritious
			health foods, but you know that.  Listen,
			that reminds me, I'm having a party for all
			my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth
			anniversary as an accountant.  I know you
			fill out your own tax return, but I'd like
			you to come being that you're my next door
			neighbor and all ...


			Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if
			I'm around.


			You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so
			loud when you go out.  That creep down the
			hall phoned the manager.


			I thought I turned it off.
				(she listens and hears
				loud sound coming from
				inside)
			I guess I forgot.




			I climbed on the window ledge to see if I
			could disconnect the cable but I couldn't
			reach so I turned up the sound on my TV real
			loud so they'd think there was something
			wrong with everybody's TV.  You know, you
			and I should really have keys to each
			other's apartment ...





			... in case of emergencies ...
				(he discovers he has
				locked himself out of his
				apartment)
			... like this one.



























			What is it?  What's wrong?


			Look!




				
			Oh, dear.  It's that darn ghost again.
			Can't you do something about it.


				
			I've tried everything, honey!  I guess we'll
			just have to move.




			Gee, there must be a better way.




			Are you troubled by strange noises in the
			night?  Do you experience feelings of dread
			in your basement or attic?  Have you or your
			family actually seen a spook, specter or
			ghost?  If the answer is yes, then don't
			wait another minute.  Just pick up the phone
			and call the professionals -- Ghostbusters.







				
			Our courteous and efficient staff is on call
			24 hours a day to serve all your supernatural
			elimination needs.






				
			Ghostbusters.  We'll be right there.







				
			Got him!  I don't think you'll have any more
			trouble with that ghost.






				
			And it's economical, too!


			How can we ever thank you?


				
			All in a day's work, ma'am. After all ...
				
			... We're Ghostbusters.
				






				
			If you have a ghost,
			But you don't want to play host,
			You can't sleep at all,
			So who do you call ...
			Ghostbusters - Ghostbusters.






				
			We're ready to believe you,

















































				(whispers loudly and
				hoarsely)
			ZUUL!!!




































			Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How
			do you like it?


				
			Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?


			Fourteen hundred.




			Just needs a little suspension work ... And
			a muffler ... And maybe brakes.









				(with a definitive Queens
				accent)
			You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you
			like to read a lot, too.


				
			Print is dead.


			That's very fascinating to me.  I read a
			lot myself.  Some people think I'm too
			intellectual.  But I think reading is a
			fabulous way to spend your spare time.
				
			I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?


			Is that a game?


			It's a great game!  You should play
			sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem
			very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?


			I collect spores, molds and fungus.


			Oh, that's very - unusual.


			I think it's the food of the future.


			Remind me not to go to lunch with you.










				
			Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?


			Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have
			to say may sound a little ... unusual.


			We're all professionals here, Miss ...


			Barrett.  Dana Barrett.




			Why don't you step into the office and we'll
			talk about it.
				
			Hold all my calls, Janine.


			What calls?









			... and then I opened the door again but it
			was gone.  There was nothing there.


				
			So what do you think it was?








				
			I think something in my refrigerator is
			trying to get me.




			Generally, you don't see that kind of
			behavior in a major appliance.  What do you
			think, Egon?


				
			She's telling the truth -- or at least she
			thinks she is.


				
			Why would anyone make up a thing like that?


			Some people like the attention.  Some people
			are just crazy.


				
			You know, Peter, this could be a past life
			experience intruding on the present.


			Or even a race memory, stored in the
			collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule
			out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.




				
			I'm sorry.  It's just that I don't believe
			in any of these things.  I don't even know
			my sign.


				
			You're a Scorpio with your moon in Leo and
			Aquarius rising.


			Is that good?


			It means you're bright, ambitious, outgoing
			and very, very sexy,





			Is that your professional opinion?


			It's in the stars.


			Why don't I check out the building?  It may
			have a history of psychic turbulence.


			Good idea.
				
			Were any other words spoken that you
			remember?


			No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have
			no idea what it means.


			Spengler,  see if you can find the word
			"Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take
			Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.







			Have you ever thought of moving out -- at
			least until this disturbance blows over?


			No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging
			that what happened was real.  I'm not ready
			to do that.




			You play the cello!  It's my favorite
			instrument.


			Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?


				
			I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.


			That's a violin concerto.


			Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.





			You really don't act like a scientist.


			No?  What do I act like?


			Like a used car salesman.


			Thanks.
				(he gets down to business
				and starts looking around
				the apartment)
			What's in there?




			That's the bedroom, but nothing ever
			happened in there.




				
			That's too bad.


			What?


			Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?




				
			Uh-huh.


			Well, let's check it out.


			I'll wait here if you don't mind.









				
			You're quite a housekeeper.


				
			I told you, I ...


			I know.  It happened by itself.




			Nothing.






			Damn!


				
			Are you all right?


			Yeah, yeah.









			There's nothing there now and I don't get
			any significant readings.


			This is terrible.  Either there's a monster
			in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.


			If it's any comfort to you, I don't think
			you're crazy.


				
			Thanks.  Coming from you that really means
			a lot to me.


			I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a
			degree and everything.  I believe that
			something happened here and I want to do
			something about it.


			All right.  What do you want to do?


			I think I should spend the night here.


				
			That's it.  Get out.


			On a purely scientific basis.


			Out!


			I want to help you.


			I'll scream.


			Don't scream.


				
			Then leave.


			Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens,
			you have to promise you'll call me.


				
			All right.


			Okay.  Then I'll go.


			Goodbye.


				
			No kiss?






















			How was your date?


			It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.


			Did you see anything?


			Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything.
			Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to
			worry.  You said your graph was pointing to
			something big.  You told me things were
			going to start popping.


			They will.


			Do you know when that might be?  We're on
			the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.























			Aren't you glad we waited?


			I don't know.  It probably would've been the
			same.


				
			Well, thanks a lot.






			What are you doing?  Are you just going to
			roll over and go to sleep?
				
			I don't believe this.



















			Roy?  Your clock broke.


			Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.


			I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!




			Now where are you going?


			To the bathroom, where do you think?


				
			Have I done the right thing?






				
			Roy?  Are you all right?




				
			Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!


			Uuuuuuugh!!


				
			What's the matter, dear?





			What did you do in here?  It smells awful!!
			OH ... Oh, no ... Oh, my God.





			... right ... It's smelling up the whole
			suite ... I don't know ... It's just hanging
			off the ceiling ... I've never seen anything
			like this ... 1210 ... Quick ...







			Ghostbusters ... Yes, it is ... Yes, of
			course they're serious.  You do!  You have!
			Yes, sir.  Well, they're out on another case
			now, but if you'll give me the address ...
			Don't worry, they'll be totally discreet.

























































				
			Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests
			are starting to ask questions and I'm running
			out of excuses.


			Has this ever happened before?


			Well, most of the original staff knows about
			the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I
			mean ... But it's been quiet for years ...
			Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever
			this bad, though.


			Did you ever report it to anyone?


			Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to
			even talk about it.  I hoped we could take
			care of this quietly tonight.


			Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind
			of thing all the time.









			What are you supposed to be?


			Me?  We're ... uh ... the exterminators.
			Somebody saw a cockroach on the twelfth floor.





			That's gotta be some cockroach,


			Well, you can't be too careful with those
			babies.








			I just realized something.  We've never had
			a completely successful test with any of the
			equipment.


			I blame myself.


			So do I.


			No sense worrying about it now.


				
			Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed
			nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.

























				
			Cease fire!








				
			Sorry, Buddy!


			We'd better adjust our streams.








				
			Something was definitely here.


			Yeah, I can smell it.


			I'm getting high readings near the air
			vents.  It must be using the duct system to
			get around.  See, I told you we'd get
			something.


			So far all we got is a shit smell on the
			twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto
			Rican bellboy.


			All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes.
			These things can sense them.













				
			Yes?


				
			Were you recently in the bathroom?


				
			What on earth gave you that idea?


				
			The wet towels, residual moisture on your
			lower limbs and hair, the redness in your
			cheeks indicating ...


				
			You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what
			do you want?


			When you were in the bathroom, did you
			notice anything that was yellow and
			unusually smelly?
















				
			Egon!  I got something.  I'm moving in.





				
			Yaaaaaaaaah!









				
			Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?


				
			God, it's ugly!












				(whispers into his head
				set)
			I'm moving in.  I don't think it's seen me
			yet.










			Ugh!  What a slob!  I'm going to take him.
				
			Freeze, Potato-Face!














			He's getting away!


























			This bites it.  I actually work for a
			company called Ghostbusters.






				
			Ray -- Something's here.


				(crackling over the
				communicator)
			Where are you, Pete?


				
			Third floor.  Get down here,


			Sit tight.  I'm on my way.


			Well, hurry up.
				
			The needle's going wild.













				
			It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.


				
			Don't move.  It won't hurt you.


			How do you know?


			I don't know.  I'm just guessing.




				
			Well, I think you guessed wrong.  Here he
			comes!











				
			Veeaaaaaahh!








			Aagghh -- aaaggghh -- uhh -- uhh -- It slimed
			me!  It slimed me!




			Ray!  It's here!  It just went into the
			Banquet Room on the third floor.









			Visors down.  Full stream.









			There!  On the ceiling!
				
			Come on down here, you slug!















				
			Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to
			tell you.


			What?


				
			Don't cross the beams.


			Why not?


			Trust me.  It will be bad.


			What do you mean "bad?"


			It's hard to explain, but try to imagine
			all life as you know it stopping
			instantaneously and finding yourself
			confined forever in another dimension.




				
			That's it!  I'm taking charge.  You guys
			are dangerous.




			Now nobody does anything unless I order you
			to, okay?







			Let's do it.  This thing's not going to hang
			around all day waiting for us.  Ray, give me
			one stream wide right of it. I'll go wide
			left.  Now!







				
			Good ... Good ... Nice and wide ... Move
			with him ... Easy.  Hold steady.







				
			Now, very slowly, Ray, let's tighten it up.
			You hold steady.  I'm coming down.




				
			Don't cross them!  Watch it!







			Spengler! A little help!  Cut him off.






















				
			I'll nudge it out of the corner.  You cut
			off the left side.





				
			You got it!  That's good.  Easy now.





			It's working!


			Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my
			trap now.









			Easy ... Easy ... Open the trap now!!








			Watch it ... Watch it ... Now!














				
			He's in here.






				(pulling off his slimy
				visor)
			Well!  That wasn't so bad, was it?




			Are you kidding?  That was like trying to
			push smoke into a bottle with a baseball
			bat.  Now what do we do with it?












				
			We'll have to work on that.
				
			Grab that, would you, Ray?










			What happened?  Did you see it?  What is it?





			We got it!




			What was it?  Will there be any more of them?


			Sir, what you had there was what we refer
			to as a focused, non-terminal repeating
			phantasm or a Class Five Full Roaming Vapor
			... A real nasty one, too.


				
			That'll be $4,000 for the entrapment plus
			$1,000 for proton recharge and storage.


				
			Five thousand dollars!  I won't pay it.  I
			had no idea it would be so much.


			Fine.  We'll let it go again.
				
			Ray!  Bring it back.


			No!  All right.  Anything.











			Nate Cohen.  I'm with the Post.  What
			happened in there?


			Did you really see a ghost?


			Is this some kind of a stunt?


				(holding up the trap;
				loudly to the crowd)
			We got one!


			Can we see it?


			Uh...I'm afraid not.


			This is not a sideshow!  We're serious
			scientists.


			What proof do you have that what you saw
			was real?


			Proof?  Well, the manager of the Sedgewick
			just paid us five big ones to get something
			out of there.  Is that real enough for you?


			Are you saying that ghosts really exist?


				
			Not only do they exist, they're all over
			the place!  And that's why we're offering
			this vitally important service to people in
			the whole tri-state area.  We're available
			twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
			We have the tools and we have the talent.
			No job too small, no fee too big.  We're
			ready for anything.








			Mister!  Hey, Mister!  Come here!  Mister.




			Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?


			They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.


			Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.


			I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.




			Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If
			you like shot Superman with those guns, would
			he feel it or what?


				
			On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could
			slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.


			Wow!







			Sing the song from your commercial.


				
			No, we have to get back and ...


				
			Come on.  It's free advertising.


			There's a thought.  Hit it, Ray.





				
			Ghostbusters ... If you have a ghost
			But you don't want to play host ...




				
			They can be bad houseguests
			And all-night pests ...
			You can't sleep at all
			So who do you call?





				
			Ghostbusters ... Ghostbusters.


















			Hello, America.  This is Ronald Gwynne
			reporting from United Press International
			in New York.  Throughout my entire career
			as a journalist I have never reported
			anything as exciting and incredible as the
			trapping of an actual supernatural entity
			by a team of men based in this city who call
			themselves Ghostbusters.







			Now, most of us have never even heard of a
			floating, slime-like substance called
			ectoplasm, but these gentlemen claim we will
			be seeing a lot more of it than ever before.














			Good morning.  Today the entire Eastern
			Seaboard is alive with talk of hundreds of
			reported incidents involving multiple
			sightings in what can only be described as
			extreme events of paranormal extraphenomenical
			proportions.  It seems everybody is willing
			to bring their old ghosts and skeletons out
			of the closet.  Roy Brady reports from New
			York.






			Thank you, Roger.  Everybody's heard ghost
			stories around the campfire.  Heck, my
			grandma used to spin yarns about a spectral
			locomotive that used to rocket past the farm
			where she grew up.  Now, as if some unseen
			authority had suddenly given permission,
			thousands of people here are talking about
			encounters they claim to have had with ghosts.










































			Ray, every time I hear about your company,
			I can't help thinking about the old Bob Hope
			movie.


			Actually, Joe, the title of that film was
			"Ghostbreakers," and Olsen and Johnson did
			one called "Ghost Catchers" and the Bowery
			Boys did "Ghost Chasers," "Hold That Ghost,"
			"Spooks Run Wild," "Spook Busters," and
			"Spook Chasers."


			Well, in any case, I guess there's one big
			question on everybody's mind and you're
			certainly in a position to answer it for us:
			Have you seen Elvis and how is he?






			Our phone-in topic today: Ghosts and
			Ghostbusting.  The controversy builds as more
			sightings are reported and some maintain that
			these professional paranormal eliminators in
			New York are the cause of it all.  Why did
			everything start just when these guys went
			into business?







			Should they be allowed to carry around
			unlicensed proton mass drivers?  And what's
			wrong with ghosts anyway?  Call us ... All
			our lines are open.  Hello, Larry King.






			Hello, Larry?  I think what Dr. Spengler
			said in his interview with you last night
			was true.  The world is in for a "psychic
			shock" 'cause like my aunt reads coffee
			grounds and she ...
				





			Great rehearsal.


			You heard it?


			You're the best one in your row.


				
			Most people can't hear me with the whole
			orchestra playing.  You're good.


			I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have
			other people dying to give it to me.


			I know.  You're quite a celebrity these
			days.  Are you here because you have info
			... about my case?


				(looks at the Violinist
				who appears to be getting
				impatient)
			Who's the stiff?


			The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the
			finest musicians in the world and a wonderful
			man.


			Is he dying or something?












			He is a very close friend.  Do you have some
			explanation of what happened in my apartment?


			Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a
			fine restaurant.


			Can't you tell me now?


			I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the
			name "Zuul" in ...
				
			The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and
			Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.


			You must have gotten the last copy.


			Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god
			worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ...
			What's that say?


			Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the
			Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."


			"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian
			religion.  One of their gods.


			What's he doing in my refrigerator.


			I'm checking on that.  I think we should
			meet Thursday night at nine to talk about
			it.


			I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.


				
			You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to
			spend time with clients?  I'm making an
			exception because I respect you as an artist
			and as a dresser.


				
			All right.  Since you put it that way.


			I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring
			along the Roylance Guide -- we can read
			after we eat.


			I've got to go now.




			Remember.  I'm the only one standing between
			you and a heavy Hittite.




				
			I'll pick you up at your place.








				
			Who was that?


			Oh, he's an old professor of mine.


				
			Really?


			Yes.  He's smarter than he looks.










				
			GHOSTBUSTERS -- please hold.
				
			Good afternoon, GHOSTBUSTERS -- please hold.
				
			Yes, can I help you?
				
			Yes ... yes,  Is it just a mist or does it
			have arms and legs ...?  Uh-huh ... Well,
			the soonest we could possibly get to you
			would be a week from Friday ... I'm sorry,
			but we're completely booked until then ...
			Uh-huh ... Well, all I can suggest is that
			you stay out of your house until we can get
			to you.  Thank you.




			Let me ask you something.  The ad in the
			paper just said "Help Wanted."  What's the
			job?


			I really don't know, Mr. Zeddemore.  They
			just told me to take applications and ask
			you these questions.
				(she reads from a
				questionnaire as if for
				the hundredth time)
			Do you believe in U.F.O.'s, astral
			projection, mental telepathy, ESP,
			clairvoyance, spirit photography,
			full-trance mediums, telekinetic movement,
			black and/or white magic, pyramidology, the
			theory of Atlantis, the Loch Ness Monster,
			or in general in spooks, spectres, wraiths,
			geists and ghosts?


			Not really.  However, if there's a
			semi-regular paycheck in it I'll believe
			anything you say.














				
			Boy, that was a rough one.


			I can't take much more of this.  The pace
			is killing me.







			Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She
			paid with a Visa card.


				(hands a sheaf of work
				orders to Stantz)
			Here are tonight's calls.


				
			Oh, no.  Two more free-roaming repeaters.


			And this is Winston Zeddemore.  He came
			about the job.


			Hi.  Ray Stantz.  Pete Venkman.




				
			And someone from the EPA is here to see you.


			The EPA?  What's he want?


			I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I
			haven't had a break in two weeks and you
			promised you'd hire more help.


				
			Janine, I'm sure a woman with your
			qualifications would have no trouble finding
			a top flight job in the housekeeping or food
			service industry.


			Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs
			than this one, believe me.









			Very impressive resume.  Electronic
			countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ...
			Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert
			... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard,
			we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with
			streams of concentrated quantum energy and
			remove them from people's homes, offices and
			places of worship.


			Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you
			really do.








			Can I help you?


				
			I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the
			Environmental Protection Agency, Third
			District.


				
			Great!  How's it going?


			Are you Peter Venkman?


			Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.




			Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr.
			Venkman?


			I have Ph.D's in psychology and
			parapsychology.


			I see.  And now you catch ghosts?


			You could say that.


			And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr.
			Venkman?


			I'm not at liberty to say.


			And where do you put these ghosts once you
			catch them?


			In a storage facility.


			And would this storage facility be located
			on these premises?


			Yes, it would.


			And may I see this storage facility?


			No, you may not.


			And why not, Mr. Venkman?


			Because you didn't say the magic word.


				
			And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?


			The magic word is "please."




			May I please see the storage facility?


			Why do you want to see it?


			Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know
			more about what you do here.  Frankly, there
			have been a lot of wild stories in the media
			and we want to assess any possible
			environmental impact from your operation.
			For instance, the storage of noxious,
			possibly hazardous waste materials in your
			basement.  Now either you show me what's down
			there or I come back with a court order.


				
			Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm
			gonna sue your ass off for wrongful
			prosecution.


				
			Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.


				
			Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!















				
			Set entry grid.


			Neutronize.  System shut.







			I've got to sleep.


			I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid
			around the storage facility holding up?


			I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in
			there.  And all my recent data points to
			something big on the bottom.


				
			What do you mean "big?"




			Well, let's say this Twinkie represents the
			normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the
			New York area.  According to this morning's
			PKE sample, the current level in the city
			would be a Twinkie 35 feet long weighing
			approximately six hundred pounds.


			That's a big Twinkie.


			We could be on the verge of a fourfold
			crossover ... or worse.  If what we're
			seeing indicates a massive PKE surge, we
			could experience an actual rip.




			Egon, how's the grid around the storage
			facility holding up?


			It's not good, Pete.


			Tell him about the Twinkie.





				
			I can't look anymore.  It's too depressing.










































			Oh, Dana, it's you.


			Hi, Louis.


			Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a
			classic party.


			Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming
			by.


			Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better
			hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese
			and they're almost gone.  I'll make some
			more though.


				
			Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.


			I got the Twister game for later ...





				
			Hey.  Lemme in ...










			Hello ... Oh, hi Mom.  Yes ... yes.
			Everything's fine.  No ... nothing.  Just
			that one time ... I am ... I will ... I
			won't ... Mother!  I'm all right.  I told
			you.  Everything's fine ...!  All right.
			I'll talk to you tomorrow ... I promise.
			'Bye.













			Oh, shit!





















































			Louis, do you have any Excedrin or Extra
			Strength Tylenol?


			I have acetacylasilic acid but generic from
			Walgreens cause I can get 600 tables for 35%
			less than the cost of 300 name brand.  Is it
			a headache?









			That's Nova Scotia salmon.  The real thing.
			It costs $24.95 a pound but really $12.48 a
			pound net after tax.  I'm writing this whole
			party off as a promotional expense.  That's
			why I invited clients instead of friends.
			Try that Brie, it's dynamite at room
			temperature.  Maybe I should turn the heat
			up a bit ...




			C'mon Louis, maybe if we dance other people
			will start.







			Everybody, this is Ted and Annette Fleming.
			Ted has a small carpet cleaning business in
			receivership, but Annette is drawing a
			salary from a deferred bonus from two years
			ago and the house has $15,000 left at eight
			percent.















			Okay.  Who brought the dog?




































			Help! Help!  There's a bear loose in my
			apartment.






				
			How he's got animals up there.









			I think you're right about Central America
			but I completely disagree about the other
			thing.  A good heavyweight boxer could take
			a Karate guy every time.




				
			Run!  Run!




				
			Rush, rush, rush.





			That is one speedy mutt.


			He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with
			that particular breed.


			Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I
			think.






















				
			Help!  Help!


















				
			Nice doggie.  Nice.

















				
			I am Vinz Clortho.  Keymaster of Gozer,
			Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the Sebouillia.
			Are you the Gatekeeper?




			Hey!  He pulls the wagon.  I make the deals.
			You wanna ride?


				
			Are you the Gatekeeper?


			No, I'm the Governor of New Jersey.  Now get
			outta here.




				
			You will perish in flames, subcreature!
			Gozer will destroy you and your kind!
				
			Wait for the sign.  Then all prisoners will
			be released.
















			What's going on?


			Some moron brought a cougar to a party and
			it went berserk,


			Oh.









				
			Dana?








			Hi.
				(he notes the change in
				her)
			What happened to you? The cop downstairs
			said an animal got loose up here.  What's
			the story?  Are you all right?




			Are you the Keymaster?




			Not that I know of.





				
			Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?


			I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.





			I think we better get out of here.







			We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.


				
			Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some
			dip or something?


			He is the Destructor.


			Really?  Can't wait to meet him.
				
			As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really
			like to try something with you -- in the
			bedroom.








				
			Do you want this body?


				
			Well, I'll just use it for a while and get
			it right back to you.


			Take me now.




			Well, I make it a rule never to sleep with
			possessed people.




				
			Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.


				
			I want you inside me.


				
			I don't know.  You've got two people in
			there already.  It could get a little
			crowded.
				(he gently pushes her back
				down on the bed)
			I want you to close your eyes and relax.
				
			Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want
			Dana to answer.


			I am Zuul.  I am ...


			Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want
			Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...


				(in a low, horrible
				unearthly voice)
			There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.


				
			Whoa!! Nice voice.





				
			All right -- Zuul.  Listen carefully.  I
			don't know where you came from or why, but
			I want you to get out of here and leave Dana
			alone.  I'm going to count to ten and when
			I'm finished, you better be gone.  Okay?
			Here goes.  One ... Two ... Three ...





				
			Wow!
















			Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with
			there?


			Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the
			structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's
			apartment building ... And they're most
			unusual.


				
			Are you a Christian, Ray?


				
			Mmmhmmm.


			Me, too.


				(reacting to something in
				the blueprint)
			Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.


			Do you believe in God?


			No.  But I liked Jesus' style.


			Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.


				
			The whole roof cap was fabricated with a
			magnesium-tungsten alloy.


			Ray, do you remember something in the Bible
			about a day when the dead would rise up from
			their graves?


				(still absorbed by the
				blueprint)
			And the seas would boil ...


			Right.  And the sky would fall ...


			Judgement Day ...


			Yeah, Judgement Day.


			Every ancient religion had its own myth
			about the end of the world.


			Well, has it ever occurred to you that the
			reason you've been so busy lately is because
			the dead have been rising from their graves?











			Evening.  We've had a problem here for quite
			some time.  I called your outfit a couple of
			weeks ago.


			Busy time of year.


			Nobody likes to talk about this sort of thing.


			You don't have to worry about that with us,
			sir.


			Right.  We'll believe anything.







			You check the armory.  I'll go down to the
			officers' barracks.












			We picked up this guy and now we don't know
			what to do with him, Bellevue doesn't want
			him and I'm afraid to put him in the
			lock-up.  I'm telling you, there's something
			weird about him.  And I know you guys are
			into this stuff so we figured we'd check
			with you.









				
			Are you the Gatekeeper?




			Bring him inside, Officer.









			I am Vinz Clortho - Keymaster of Gozer.


				
			I am Egon Spengler, Creature of Earth,
			Doctor of Physics, Graduate of M.I.T.


				(looking through Louis'
				wallet)
			According to this his name is Louis Tully.


			Oh, no.  Tully is the fleshbag I'm using.
			I must wait inside for the sign.


			Do you want some coffee while you're waiting?


				
			Do I?


			Yes, have some.
				(Janine goes to the table
				and puts some water up to
				boil)
			Vinz, what sign are you waiting for?


			Gozer the Traveller will come in one of the
			pre-chosen forms.  During the rectification
			of the Vuldronaii the Traveller came as a
			very large and moving Torb.  Then of course
			in the third reconciliation of the last of
			the Meketrex supplicants they chose a new
			form for him, that of a Sloar.  Many Shubs
			and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in
			the depths of the Sloar that day I can tell
			you.










			Hello?







			It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.




			What is it?


			I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating
			three feet off the bed.


			Does she want to be?


			I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer
			thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does
			that make any sense to you?


			Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here
			with me now.
				(there's a long silence
				on the other end)
			Venkman?  Are you there?


			Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It
			probably wouldn't be a good idea for them
			to get together at this point.


			I agree.


			You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you
			have to, but don't let him leave,  He could
			be very dangerous.












				
			All right.  I'll try.


			I'll spend the night here and get back first
			thing in the morning.


			All right, Peter.  Good night.








				
			Egon, there's something very strange about
			that man.
				
			I'm very psychic usually and right now I
			have this terrible feeling that something
			awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid
			you're going to die.


			Die in what sense?


			In the physical sense.


			I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a
			vast organism, like two bacteria living on
			a rotting speck of dust floating in an
			infinite void.


			That's so romantic.





				
			You have nice clavicles.
				
			I wonder where Stantz is.  I think we're
			going to need him.












































































			Stantz?  You okay in there?


				
			LATER, MAN!!
















				
			This way, Captain.


				(rushes over to block
				their way)
			I beg your pardon!  Just where do you think
			you're going?


			Step aside, Miss, or I'll have you arrested
			for interfering with a police officer.


				
			Who do you think you're talking to, Mister?
			Do I look like a child?  You can't come in
			here without some kind of warrant or writ or
			something.




				
			Cease and desist all commerce order, seizure
			of premises and chattels, ban on the use of
			public utilities for non-licensed waste
			handlers and a Federal Entry and Inspection
			Order.


				
			This is just like Poland.









				
			I want to see what's in there.  Now either
			you shut off those "beams" or we'll shut
			them off for you.


				
			You can see what's inside through the
			monitor if you wish.




				
			I'm not interested in TV right now.











				
			At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I
			think there's been some kind of
			misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate
			in every way I can.


				
			Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to
			cooperate but you thought it was more fun to
			insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.


				
			He wants to shut down the storage grid.


			If you turn that thing off we won't be
			responsible for the consequences.


			On the contrary!  You will be held
			completely responsible.
				
			Turn it off.





				
			Don't do it!  I'm warning you.






			I've never seen anything like this before.
			I don't know ...


				
			Just do it, fella.  Nobody asked for your
			opinion.




				
			Don't be a jerk!




			If he tries that again, shoot him.




				
			You do your job, pencil-neck.  Don't tell
			us how to do ours.


			Thank you, Officer.


				
			Now turn it off.



























































			It is time.  This is the sign.


			It's a sign, all right ... "Going Out Of
			Business."
























			... does it contain TCE, PCB or tailings
			from styrene esters or any polyfluoric
			groups...?


			What are the pink particles?  What will
			happen if we use water?




			No ... no water.  There's nothing you can do.


			Did you have any kind of solvents or any
			concentrated sulphurs of any kind?





			What happened??!!!?


			The storage facility blew.  This one ...
				
			... shut off the protection grid.






				
			Where's the Keymaster?


				
			Oh, shit!


				
			Who's the Keymaster?





				
			Stop them!  I want them arrested, Captain.
			These men have been acting in criminal
			violation of the Environmental Protection
			Act and this explosion was a direct result.




				
			You turned off the power!
				
			Look, there was another man here ... You
			have to find him and bring him back.  A
			short determined-looking guy with the eyes
			of a happy zombie.


				
			See!  They are using drugs.




			If you don't shut up I'm going to rip out
			your septum.




				
			I don't know what's going on here but I'm
			going to have to arrest you all.  You can
			discuss it with the judge.  I'm going to
			read you your rights now, so please listen
			carefully ...















































			Gulf and Western Building!  And I'm in a
			hurry so let's not dawdle.



























































				
			Okay ... give me.




			Are you the Gatekeeper?


			Come on.  You want me to stick you?  Come
			on.


			I am Vinz Clortho.  I am the Keymaster.  Do
			you bar my way?


			Are you crazy, man?  You don't give, Jino's
			gonna rip you, man.  Nobody gets by Jino.


				
			Do you bar my way?


			Yeah.  We bar your way.

























			ALL NIGHT ALL DAY HORROR SHOW IN 3-D



































				
			We're gonna get five years for this.  Plus
			they're gonna make us retrap all those
			spooks.  I knew I shouldn't have taken this
			job.





				
			Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It
			looks exactly like the kind of telemetry
			tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars
			in other galaxies.


			And look at this, Peter
				
			Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.










				
			Everybody with us so far?




				
			The ironwork extends down through fifty feet
			of bedrock and touches the water table!




				
			I guess they don't build them like they used
			to, huh?


			No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The
			architect was either an authentic whacko or
			a certified genius.  The whole building is
			like a huge antenna for pulling in and
			concentrating psychokinetic energy.


			Who was the architect?


			He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.


				
			Of course!
				(the others turn and look
				at him)
			Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's
			SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society
			in 1920.


				
			Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.


			Yes.  After the First World War Shandor
			decided that society was too sick to
			survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close
			to a thousand followers when he died.  They
			conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended
			to bring about the end of the world.


				(now very worried about
				Dana)
			She said he was "the Destructor."


			Who?


			Gozer.


				
			You talked to Gozer?


			Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to
			Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as
			the Destructor.


				
			See?  I told you something big was about to
			happen.




			This is insane!  You actually believe that
			some moldy Babylonian God is going to drop
			in at 78th and Central Park West and start
			tearing up the city?


				
			Sumarian -- not Babylonian,





			Are you the Ghostbusters?


			What about it?


			The  mayor wants to see you -- right away.
			The whole island is going crazy.  Let's go.









				
			Are you under arrest?  Did you have a bomb
			factory in the basement?  What are you going
			to do about all these ghosts?
















				(entering with the
				Ghostbusters)
			The Ghostbusters are here, Mr. Mayor.









				
			Okay, the Ghostbusters.  And who's Peck?




				
			I'm Walter Peck, sir.  And I'm prepared to
			make a full report.
				
			These men are complete snowball artists.
			They use nerve and sense gases to induce
			hallucinations.  The people think they're
			seeing ghosts and call these bozos, who
			conveniently show up to get rid of the
			problem with a fake electronic light show.


				
			You using nerve gas?


			The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.


			Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen
			from the Army ...


			Bullshit!!!


			... improperly stored and touched off with
			those high-voltage laser beams they use in
			their light show.  They caused an explosion.




			All I know is, that wasn't a light show we
			saw this morning.  I've seen every form of
			combustion known to man, but this beats me.


			And nobody's using nerve gas on all the
			people that have seen those ... things ...
			all over the city.  The walls were bleeding
			at the 53rd Precinct.  How do you explain
			that?





			Officially, the Church will not take a
			position on the religious implications of
			these ... phenomena.  However, since they
			started, people have been lining up at every
			church in the city to confess and take
			communion.  We've had to put on extra
			priests.  Personally, I think it's a sign
			from God but don't quote me on that.


				
			I can't call a press conference and tell
			everyone to start praying.






			I'm Winston Zeddemore, Your Honor.  I've
			only been with the company for a couple of
			weeks, but I gotta tell you -- these things
			are real.  Since I joined these men I have
			seen shit that would turn you white.






				
			So what do I do now?






			Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice.
			You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...


				
			That's "Peck!"


				
			... or you can accept the fact that this
			city is heading for a disaster of really
			Biblical proportions.


			What do you mean "Biblical?"


			Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.  "Wrath of
			God"-type stuff.  The seas could boil, fire
			and brimstone falling from the sky ...


				
			... forty years of darkness, earthquakes,
			mass hysteria, human sacrifice ...


			Enough!  I get the point.
				
			But what if you're wrong?


			If I'm wrong then nothing happens and you
			toss us in the can.  But if I'm right, and
			if we can stop this thing ... well, let's
			just say that you could save the lives of a
			lot of registered voters.





				
			I don't believe you're seriously considering
			listening to these men!




			Get him out of here.
				
			We've got work to do.  What do you need
			from me?

















			Louis!  What are you doing standing there
			... get out of the building ... don't you
			know it's an earthquake or something?


			The Traveller is coming.


			Don't be crazy.  Nobody is going to come and
			visit you with all this commotion going on.











				
			Are you the Gatekeeper?


				
			I am Zuul.













			I don't understand it,  Why here?   Why now?


			What goes around, comes around, Mr. Mayor.
			The big Lazy Susan of Karma just keeps
			turning and sometimes we get the short end
			of the stick.


			This may be Nature's way of telling us to
			slow down.  You have to admit it's kind of
			humbling, isn't it?


				
			We're humble already!  Hasn't this city
			suffered enough?












			We've cleared the whole building and
			cordonned off the street.  I'm massing our
			own special tactics squad and the National
			Guard is on standby.


			I better alert the Red Cross, too.






				
			I want you to have this.
				


			What is it?


			It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair
			at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.


			I don't believe in luck.


			Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.


			Thank you.












			Okay.  Just remember, whatever happens out
			there, we are total professionals.  Not
			only are we the best Ghostbusters around,
			we're the only Ghostbusters around.  It's
			up to us.





				
			Move 'em out!



















































				
			Ghostbusters!








				
			Are we all together on this now?


				
			I think we should get on a plane right now
			and go to Australia or Indonesia until this
			blows over.


			I'm going to make a note of your suggestion
			and possibly bring it up later if this thing
			really gets out of hand.  Now let's move.




			Get 'em!


			All right, Ghostbusters!
























			I've heard of underground parking but this
			is ridiculous.


























				
			I'm glad we took the stairs.







			Dana?


			Maybe we should go downstairs and call first?













				
			Well, she's not here.  Let's go.


			No!  The kitchen!












				
			Go!


































				
			Shit!  I've been out with some real dogs,
			but this is ridiculous!






















				
			It's Shandor - the architect!


			I thought he died!


			It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.


			I don't think it's Shandor.




			Gozer the Gozerian?










				
			As a duly-constituted representative of the
			City of New York, and on behalf of the
			County and State of New York, the United
			States of America, the Planet Earth and all
			its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease
			and desist any and all supernatural activity
			and return at once to your place of origin
			or next parallel dimension.


				
			Well, that ought to do it.






			Are you a god?


				
			No.


			Then die!










				
			You should've said "yes!"  He might have
			been willing to negotiate.




				
			Okay.  That's it!  I'm gonna turn this guy
			into toast.






















			Agile bastard, isn't he?


			Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!























				
			We neutronized him!  The guy's a molecular
			nonentity.






				
			Not necessarily.






























			SUBCREATURES!  GOZER THE GOZERIAN, GOZER
			THE DESTRUCTOR, VOLGUUS ZILDROHAR, THE
			TRAVELLER HAS COME.  CHOOSE AND PERISH.


				
			Is he talking to us?


			What's he talking about?  Choose what?


				
			What do you mean "choose?"  We don't
			understand.


			CHOOSE!!


			I think he's saying that since we're about
			to be sacrificed anyway, we get to choose
			the form we want him to take.


			You mean if I stand here and concentrate on
			the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will
			appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?


			That appears to be the case.


				
			Don't think of anything yet.  Clear your
			minds.  We only get one crack at this.


			The choice is made.  The Traveller has come.


				
			We didn't choose anything!
				
			I didn't think of an image, did you?


			No.




			My mind's a total void!




				
			I couldn't help it!  It just popped in
			there!


				
			What?  What popped in there?


				
			Look!














				
			What is it?  Ray, what did you think of?











				
			It can't be!  It can't be!












			It's ... It's ... It's the STAY-PUFT
			MARSHMALLOW MAN.













				
			I tried to think of the most harmless thing
			... something that could never destroy us
			... something I loved from my childhood.






			AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?


			The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on
			all the packages we used to buy when I was
			a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft
			marshmallows at Camp Waconda!


			Great!  The marshmallows are about to get
			their revenge.























			What now?


				
			Full-stream with strogon pulse.




				
			I guess that's all we've got.











				
			Are the Ghostbusters up there?


				
			Yeah!


			I want you to go up on the roof and arrest
			them.  This time they've gone too far.





				(knocking Peck's hands
				away)
			You arrest them, numb nuts!  I'm getting out
			of here.














				
			Hit him!
















			Good.  Now we made him mad.
























				
			We're going to be killed by a hundred-foot
			marshmallow.







				
			On the count of three!  One ... Two ...


				(he has the best idea of
				his life)
			No!  Them!  Shoot them!
				(he points at the Terror
				Dogs)
			Cross the beams.










				
			No!  You said crossing the beams would be
			BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!


			Life is just a state of mind.


			But it's my favorite state.


			Either way we're history.










				
			Now!!







































			Everybody okay?































				
			Jeez!  Somebody must have spiked the egg
			salad.






			Are you all right?




				
			Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.


				(seeing Dana for the first
				time)
			I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never
			touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.


				
			All right, what happened to me?


			Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in
			your kitchen.


			Really!  Is it gone?


			Yeah, along with most of your furniture and
			a lot of your personal possessions.  This
			one took some work.


				
			Thank you.  Next time I want to break a
			lease I'll know who to call.




			This is going to cost you, you know.  Our
			fees are ridiculously high.


			Talk to my accountant.
				


			Oh, great!  I bet we could write off all the
			damage as an Act of God.






			I'll go along with that.







			Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow
			to me.


				
			Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type
			substance - that's for sure.


			You have to wonder why anybody would dump a
			marshmallow that size right in the middle of
			the street.


			I wonder if there might not be a very large
			cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.


			That would definitely explain it.
